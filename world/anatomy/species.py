"""Species anatomy overlay (PR #202 / PR-G).

A minimal data + helpers layer that names body parts, corpses, and
locations by species and decay stage.  Designed as a *minimal overlay*
rather than a full anatomical refactor: humans are the assumed default,
and the only species shipped at the time of writing; non-humans will
register here when they exist, and severed items / organs / corpses
will pick up the new vocabulary automatically because every rendering
path consults these helpers.

Design notes
============

* **Decay-tier vocabulary** (per the PR-G design discussion):

    +-----------+----------------------------------------+
    | Stage     | Display                                |
    +===========+========================================+
    | fresh     | ``{species} {part}`` / ``{species} corpse`` |
    | early     | ``{species} {part}`` / ``{species} corpse`` |
    | moderate  | ``rotting {part}`` / ``rotting corpse`` |
    | advanced  | ``rotting {part}`` / ``rotting corpse`` |
    | skeletal  | ``skeletal {part}`` / ``skeletal remains`` |
    +-----------+----------------------------------------+

  Fresh/early stages reveal species cleanly; moderate/advanced
  obfuscate ("rotting" alone, no species clue); skeletal abandons
  species for the universal "skeletal" tag.  Players who want more
  precision than these glance-level tags must ``look`` for the full
  description (which still carries decay prose) or ``autopsy`` (which
  rolls Intellect for forensic recovery).

  Harvested **organs** follow the same shape via
  :data:`decay_organ_prefixes`, but the skeletal-tier tag is
  ``desiccated`` rather than ``skeletal`` — a heart or kidney doesn't
  skeletonize, it dries out.  See :func:`get_species_organ_name`.

* **No species in skeletal/rotting stages**: deliberate gameplay
  signal — late decay obscures species at a glance.  Once a body has
  rotted past recognition or reduced to bone, the casual observer
  can't tell a human from a synth without close examination.

* **Per-character override hook**: characters (or any object with a
  ``db.species`` attribute) consult this registry through their
  species key.  Unknown species fall back to the ``human`` definition
  rather than crashing — this keeps the system robust as new species
  are added incrementally.

* **No state stored on the helpers**: every call is a pure lookup
  against :data:`SPECIES_DEFINITIONS`.  This lets rendering code call
  the helpers on every ``get_display_name`` / ``return_appearance``
  invocation without performance concerns and lets decay drift propagate
  naturally as time passes (the source data — ``get_decay_stage()`` —
  is what changes, not the registry).
