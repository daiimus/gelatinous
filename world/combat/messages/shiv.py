        "{attacker} adjusts their grip like they're tuning an instrument. The shiv hums low, a prelude to something unspeakable.",
        "No words. Just eye contact and intent, and then the shiv blooms from their palm like a flower grown in ash.",
        "The moment stretches like gum on hot pavement. {attacker} shifts forward, and the blade follows like instinct.",
        "The draw isn’t showy—it’s clinical. {attacker} doesn’t revel in it. They’ve simply done this before. Many times.",
        "{attacker} doesn’t blink as the shiv appears. It's not menace—it’s math. You’re the variable that needs solving.",
        "You catch a glint in their sleeve too late. By the time your brain processes it, the distance is already closed.",
        "{attacker} peels back their sleeve like they’re unwrapping something sacred. The shiv slips into view, and it doesn’t glint—it glares.",
        "You don’t see the draw. One second {attacker} is empty-handed, the next they’re cradling ruin in their palm.",
        "{attacker} crouches slightly, body weight shifting like a predator before the pounce. The blade appears like it’s been summoned.",
        "{attacker}'s fingers curl around the hilt with reverence. They’re not holding a weapon—they’re embracing it.",
        "The way {attacker} produces the shiv makes it feel like a secret being told with teeth. You already know it ends badly.",
        "There’s a pause, like the world is giving you one last chance to walk away. Then {attacker} breathes out, and the blade begins to move.",
        "{attacker} breathes in deep, the way some people pray. The shiv is already in their hand, and the moment is already lost.",
        "{attacker} doesn’t draw the blade—they conjure it. Like violence is their only magic trick, and this is the final act.",
        "You notice the glint too late. {attacker}'s already moving, and the shiv is carving intent through the stale air.",
        "The edge winks at you from beneath their sleeve. {attacker}'s smile says it's personal.",
        "{attacker} leans in like they're going to whisper, but it's the shiv that speaks.",
        "It isn’t rage behind their eyes—it’s focus. Cold, surgical. The shiv is just how they underline their point.",
        "{attacker} pulls the shiv with fingers that tremble—not from fear, but anticipation. The room tightens around them like a drumskin. The blade doesn’t hum—it waits. It knows it will be fed soon.",
        "{attacker} cracks their neck and breathes out slow, as if violence is the only language they ever learned fluently. The shiv is their punctuation. In that flicker of steel, you can almost hear it whisper.",
        "From under their coat, {attacker} draws the blade like a relic. It doesn’t shine—it absorbs the light, like it’s been promised blood. Some tools are made for work. This one was made for endings.",
        "No theatrics. {attacker} just steps forward and opens the scene with a flick of steel. It’s not a warning. It’s a promise. The silence around them becomes dense, syrupy. The violence is implied.",
        "{attacker} tilts their head like they’re listening to something distant. Then the shiv is in their hand, and the silence ends. You feel it, too—that crackle of static before something ruptures.",
        "The blade isn’t new—it’s *used*, bearing the memory of a dozen exits and none of them clean. {attacker} treats it like an old friend. It’s not just a weapon. It’s a decision already made.",
        "{attacker} draws the shiv like a memory they wish they could forget. The blade is crude, worn down to jagged metal. Their eyes say they don’t plan to miss. Nothing about this is casual. The weight of the moment stains the air.",
        "{attacker} moves slow, savoring the moment. The shiv glints like a broken promise in their grip, catching the light—and maybe your reflection. There’s no tremble in their wrist. Just inevitability.",
        "No ceremony, no flair. {attacker} just steps forward and *makes room* for the shiv to exist in the world again. The tension hisses like gas from a broken pipe—danger waiting to ignite.",
        "It isn’t pulled—it’s *produced*, as if the shiv had always been part of {attacker}’s anatomy. Violence seems inevitable now, even rehearsed. Their eyes aren’t on the blade—they’re on you. The shiv is just a formality.",
        "{attacker} doesn’t speak, doesn’t blink. Just steel in hand, tension in the air, and the echo of a thousand bad choices funneling into this moment. Even the shadows seem to step back from what’s about to happen.",
        "The shiv appears between {attacker}’s fingers like a magician’s trick gone wrong. No applause—only blood in the wings waiting to spill. The weapon seems familiar to them—like they’ve seen this moment before.",
        "{attacker} palms the shiv like it's a secret they've kept too long. The blade catches the light just enough to make you wonder how many times it’s tasted blood. The blade doesn’t hum—it waits. It knows it will be fed soon.",
        "{attacker} pulls a jagged shiv from a boot, its edge corroded and wrong. No ceremony, no sound — just intent. In that flicker of steel, you can almost hear it whisper.",
        "{attacker} doesn’t draw the shiv so much as *produce* it, as if it grew from their hand. {target} probably won’t notice until it’s too late. Some tools are made for work. This one was made for endings.",
        "The shiv flickers in {attacker}'s grip like a trick of the eye. {target} sees it now — just before the pain. The silence around them becomes dense, syrupy. The violence is implied.",
        "{attacker} lets the shiv drag across their thigh, carving nothing but fear. {target} knows this isn’t a warning — it’s a promise. You feel it, too—that crackle of static before something ruptures.",
        "{attacker} mutters something inaudible and steps forward. The shiv’s edge gleams like a stolen tooth in the dark. It’s not just a weapon. It’s a decision already made.",
        "{attacker} rolls their wrist, and out slides a sliver of rusted cruelty. No flourish — this isn't theater. It's murder. Nothing about this is casual. The weight of the moment stains the air.",
        "The alley holds its breath as {attacker} reveals the shiv. It's not the sharpness that matters — it's the resolve. There’s no tremble in their wrist. Just inevitability.",
        "There’s no announcement, no bravado. Just {attacker}, the shiv, and a look that says: *you won’t walk away.* The tension hisses like gas from a broken pipe—danger waiting to ignite."

    "hit": [
        "The blade enters like a forgotten memory—jagged, familiar, cruel. {target} reacts too late, their body already rewriting itself around the wound.",
        "A breath, a twitch, a hole. {attacker} doesn't gloat—they just withdraw the blade like a surgeon uninterested in survival.",
        "It lands in the side of {target}’s neck, not deep enough to kill, but deep enough to hum. The blade vibrates with residual hatred.",
        "There’s a squelch, a gasp, a moment of disconnect. {target} blinks rapidly, as if trying to stay tethered to now.",
        "The strike is clean but not kind. Blood jets in a short arc before gravity remembers how it works.",
        "{attacker} plunges it in like they’re cashing a check. There’s no ceremony, just cold arithmetic.",
        "The shiv punches through the soft part of {target}'s side with a hiss. The sound it makes is wrong—intimate, surgical, inevitable.",
        "{attacker} doesn't pull back. They lean in, twisting the blade until {target}'s knees find the floor like they’ve been there before.",
        "{target} flinches and still the blade finds home. Not deep, not shallow—just *right*. The way a predator knows where to bite.",
        "It enters with almost no resistance. {target}'s expression shudders between shock and revelation. Like they’re seeing something they can’t unsee.",
        "The shiv bites down like it’s got its own will. Blood blossoms in slow motion, thick and floral.",
        "Pain is a second thought. First comes the *sensation*—a hollowing, a rewiring. The body trying to forget the blade even as it welcomes it.",
        "The shiv digs in with all the grace of a rusted key in a lock. {target} opens in all the wrong ways.",
        "{attacker} carves a line through {target}'s midsection like they're editing a sentence. The correction is brutal.",
        "A short jab, almost casual, turns into agony. {target} folds inward, hands already slick with blood.",
        "{attacker} plunges the blade and pauses, letting the weight of it settle. {target} gasps like they finally understand the rules.",
        "The shiv punctures fabric and skin and certainty. Everything after feels like a blur of red and regret.",
        "{attacker} doesn't stab—they *press*. Slow. Relentless. The point enters like a secret meant to ruin someone.",
        "The blade punches into {target} with the sound of wet cloth tearing. Their eyes widen, and for a second, it’s like they’ve forgotten what a body is made of. Each inch of steel carries memory. This one adds yours to the ledger.",
        "It’s not the entry that ruins {target}. It’s the twist. {attacker} rotates the blade slow, deliberate, like stirring sugar into coffee. The blood isn’t just red—it’s warm, sticky, insistent. It wants to stay.",
        "{attacker} jams the shiv in low and pulls it sideways, carving a path through {target}’s ability to stand upright. The air reeks of copper and regret. There’s an intimacy to it. You feel your body betray you, welcoming the blade.",
        "There’s a crunch as steel meets bone, and {target} stumbles back, hand to their gut. It won’t help. Nothing will. Pain floods in delayed, like bad news down a phone line.",
        "The blade finds its mark beneath {target}’s ribs. There’s a moment of stillness, like the world needs a second to process what just happened. The room doesn’t change, but the way you fit inside it does.",
        "The shiv disappears into flesh and comes out howling. {target} clutches the wound, but their hands are shaking too hard to hold anything in. The scent of metal floods your nose—part steel, part self.",
        "The shiv plunges in deep—no hesitation, no mercy. {target} jerks like a marionette with its strings slashed. Blood spills, thick and unwilling. The blade pulls a sound from you you’ve never made before.",
        "It isn’t the blade that hurts—it’s the moment after, the silence, the pressure. {attacker} leaves the shiv in just long enough for {target} to remember the shape of it. Everything slows, the moment stretching around the blade like plastic.",
        "The edge opens {target} like a confession—spilling things that were meant to stay hidden. {attacker} doesn’t flinch. Doesn’t blink. The air pressure shifts as if the room is holding its breath.",
        "{attacker} lands the blow with surgical cruelty. The shiv disappears into {target}’s gut and comes out baptized. Nothing about this feels accidental. It’s not just pain—it’s history clawing up through your spine.",
        "{target} tries to step back, but the shiv is already home. The wound bubbles, ugly and wide. {attacker} watches like they’re painting. You drop something—maybe a weapon, maybe your sense of safety.",
        "You hear it before you see it: the dull thunk of steel hitting wet meat. {target} folds around the wound like a broken hinge. You weren’t ready. No one ever is for this kind of precision.",
        "{attacker} plunges the shiv into {target}'s side with a sickening crunch. The rust bites deeper than steel, and {target} knows this wound won't heal right. Each inch of steel carries memory. This one adds yours to the ledger.",
        "The blade kisses {target}'s stomach, then drags. {attacker}'s grip doesn’t shake. They've done this before. The blood isn’t just red—it’s warm, sticky, insistent. It wants to stay.",
        "Blood splashes across the pavement as {attacker} jerks the shiv from {target}'s shoulder. There’s more iron in the air now than in the weapon itself. There’s an intimacy to it. You feel your body betray you, welcoming the blade.",
        "{attacker} moves like a ghost, but the shiv is real. It finds flesh — too fast, too precise — and {target} gasps like they just remembered how breathing works. Pain floods in delayed, like bad news down a phone line.",
        "The strike is low, quick, dirty. {attacker} doesn’t wait to see if {target} screams — the shiv is already pulling back, glinting wet. The room doesn’t change, but the way you fit inside it does.",
        "Rust flakes off as the shiv slides between {target}'s ribs. {attacker} whispers something, but only the wound hears. The scent of metal floods your nose—part steel, part self.",
        "There’s no elegance in the hit — just a wet crunch and {target} reeling, clutching at something that won't stay inside. The blade pulls a sound from you you’ve never made before.",
        "The shiv finds a gap in {target}'s guard like it was drawn there. {attacker} twists. The sound is worse than the scream. Everything slows, the moment stretching around the blade like plastic.",
        "{attacker} slams the shiv down like a gavel. {target} drops like the verdict was already decided. The air pressure shifts as if the room is holding its breath.",
        "It’s not the depth of the wound — it’s where {attacker} put it. {target} buckles, air fleeing like it doesn’t want to watch. It’s not just pain—it’s history clawing up through your spine.",
        "{attacker} doesn’t aim — they *place* the blade, like they’re painting with pain. {target} shudders as the color runs. You drop something—maybe a weapon, maybe your sense of safety.",
        "The shiv punches through jacket and muscle like a lie through silence. {target} knows they've been opened. You weren’t ready. No one ever is for this kind of precision.",
        "{attacker} feints with the left and buries the shiv in the space that opened up. {target} folds in on it like a secret. Each inch of steel carries memory. This one adds yours to the ledger.",
        "Steel would have been kinder. {attacker}'s shiv rips, not cuts — and {target} is the page being torn. The blood isn’t just red—it’s warm, sticky, insistent. It wants to stay.",
        "There’s no art to it. Just {attacker}, the shiv, and {target} trying to hold in what’s already gone. There’s an intimacy to it. You feel your body betray you, welcoming the blade.",
        "The blade barely sinks in, but the look on {attacker}'s face says they’ll go deeper next time. Pain floods in delayed, like bad news down a phone line.",
        "{attacker} jams the shiv into {target}'s thigh. Mobility is a privilege — and it just got revoked. The room doesn’t change, but the way you fit inside it does.",
        "{target} jerks back too late. The shiv glances off a rib, scraping like a memory that won't leave. The scent of metal floods your nose—part steel, part self.",
        "A gout of blood arcs out as {attacker} yanks the blade free. {target} drops something — maybe hope. The blade pulls a sound from you you’ve never made before."

    "miss": [
        "The blade misses, but just barely. You feel it in the way the room stiffens, like breath held too long.",
        "{attacker} moves like they’ve done this in dreams, but dreams don’t fight back. {target} slips sideways, heart pounding.",
        "The swing is wide, theatrical almost—but behind it is history. And behind that, something worse.",
        "A blur of motion, a blur of metal. The cut never lands, but fear digs in anyway.",
        "It whistles past {target}'s hip, parting fabric, ambition, and maybe fate.",
        "Even in failure, the move paints tension across the scene. {attacker} pulls back, and the shiv looks hungry.",
        "The strike is fast—too fast. But {target} drops low, the blade carving only wind and consequence.",
        "You can hear the swing whistle by, a sound sharp enough to cut thought. {target} barely blinks, but their spine stays intact.",
        "{attacker}'s motion is smooth, practiced, almost elegant. But elegance doesn’t kill unless it connects.",
        "{target} reels back, feet slipping slightly, heart pounding. The shiv missed, but just barely enough to haunt them.",
        "The slash is wide, too wide. It carves a scar into the atmosphere, and {attacker}'s expression tightens.",
        "Steel arcs out and returns empty. The air is heavier now, like even it understands how close that was.",
        "The shiv slashes empty space, but the air winces. {target} does too.",
        "It whistles past {target}'s throat, and the sound it makes is almost curious. Like it meant to connect.",
        "{attacker} overextends, just barely. {target}'s shoulder twists out of reach by a breath and a prayer.",
        "The blade flicks too soon, and {target} stumbles backwards, wide-eyed. The message was still received.",
        "It doesn’t land, but the attempt leaves its own scar. Fear finds purchase where the steel didn’t.",
        "The lunge is violent and imperfect. The only thing {attacker} wounds is the moment.",
        "{attacker} strikes with the desperation of a cornered animal, but {target} reads it like déjà vu and slips just out of range. But even a miss cuts the air. It leaves tension behind.",
        "The shiv slices through space, the edge catching only coat threads and bad intentions. {target} lets out a breath they didn’t know they were holding. The follow-through is too smooth to be accidental.",
        "{attacker} feints left, lunges right, and still the blade hits nothing but stale air. The dance continues. Your skin remembers how close it came. So does your heart.",
        "Steel flashes but lands wide. The failure hangs heavy between them—brief, but loud in its implications. It’s a warning shot with no kindness behind it.",
        "The lunge is beautiful—graceful, even. But it’s wasted. {target} isn't there anymore. The blade doesn’t land, but the message does.",
        "A flicker of movement, a glint of metal, and then—nothing. The moment collapses, the wound never lands. The floor trembles under the sudden shift in momentum.",
        "The blade carves air, slicing the moment but not the flesh. {attacker} doesn’t seem bothered—this is a dance, and they know all the steps. You feel the draft the blade makes, colder than it should be.",
        "{target} stumbles just out of reach, the shiv singing past their ribs. Close enough to share breath, but not enough to share blood. A whisper of air across your throat reminds you how fragile you are.",
        "A flick of silver arcs wide, missing {target} by a breath. {attacker} just grins—this isn’t over, not even close. Even the miss sounds wet. Like the future was almost altered.",
        "{attacker} lunges but the shiv meets only clothing, maybe pride. {target} escapes intact—for now. The attacker recalibrates. This was just the first swing.",
        "The shiv bites wind, not flesh. Still, the weight of that moment lingers in the room like a second shadow. The walls seem to echo with the scrape of potential.",
        "No contact—just tension. {attacker} recalibrates, the shiv twitching like it’s hungry and confused by the lack of blood. Everyone watching knows this isn’t over. It just began.",
        "{attacker}'s blade whistles through the space {target} just vacated. A close call — the kind that ends in blood next time. But even a miss cuts the air. It leaves tension behind.",
        "{target} catches the movement and sidesteps. The shiv misses, but just barely. That rust-stink is still in the air. The follow-through is too smooth to be accidental.",
        "A grunt, a twitch, a slip — {attacker}'s jab goes wide and {target} stumbles back, heart racing. Your skin remembers how close it came. So does your heart.",
        "{attacker} lunges, but {target} twists. The shiv finds only jacket — and even then, it leaves a scar. It’s a warning shot with no kindness behind it.",
        "{attacker} overcommits, blade flashing past {target}'s ear. The wind from it is colder than the night. The blade doesn’t land, but the message does.",
        "The shiv strikes the wall instead with a metal-on-brick scream. {target} knows how close that was. The floor trembles under the sudden shift in momentum.",
        "{attacker} slices at the dark and finds more dark. {target} isn't where they were supposed to be. You feel the draft the blade makes, colder than it should be.",
        "The blade gleams, then glances off {target}'s boot, skittering away. {attacker} curses — quietly, urgently. A whisper of air across your throat reminds you how fragile you are.",
        "{attacker} lunges, but {target} ducks. It’s not pretty, but it works. Even the miss sounds wet. Like the future was almost altered.",
        "The alley echoes with a grunt and nothing else. {attacker} missed. {target} doesn't plan to let them try again. The attacker recalibrates. This was just the first swing.",
        "Rust flakes fall like confetti. The shiv missed. The tension didn’t. The walls seem to echo with the scrape of potential.",
        "{attacker}'s strike is sharp — just not sharp enough. {target} sways out of reach. Everyone watching knows this isn’t over. It just began.",
        "A moment too slow. The blade sings through empty air. {target} is already behind them. But even a miss cuts the air. It leaves tension behind.",
        "{target} blocks the stab with a clumsy elbow. It hurts — but it beats the alternative. The follow-through is too smooth to be accidental.",

        "You can hear the gurgle all the way across the room. {target} slumps, leaking heat and meaning.",
        "{attacker} drives the blade home and twists with finality. {target} twitches like an unplugged machine.",
        "The strike is ugly, terminal. {target} folds in on themselves like a bad idea realized too late.",
        "Blood hits the floor in heavy drops. {target} doesn't even scream—just collapses like the scene’s over.",
        "{attacker} slides the blade in slow, deliberate. {target} stiffens, then slackens, like a puppet whose strings were pulled too tight, then cut.",
        "The final wound doesn’t bleed—it sighs. {target} exhales one last time, body folding like an apology never spoken.",
        "It doesn’t matter how many times you’ve seen it. The death still lands like a punch to the ribs. {target} is gone, eyes open, chest still.",
        "A flick of the wrist, a shift of weight, and the world unravels for {target}. They fall as though something gave up inside them.",
        "There is no flourish. Just a shove, a twist, and silence that settles like dust over fresh blood.",
        "{attacker} doesn’t hesitate. They carve {target} down like a line being crossed, and when it’s over, there’s nothing left to question.",
        "{attacker} steps in, buries the shiv, and holds it there. {target} sags against them like a confession. Then drops.",
        "There’s a finality in how the blade lands—an ending more than a strike. {target} doesn't fall. They vanish.",
        "{attacker} drives the blade up beneath the ribs, lifting slightly. {target}'s legs kick once, twice, then nothing.",
        "Blood leaps from the wound like it's been waiting. {target} watches it happen in silence before their knees give out.",
        "{attacker} doesn't even look angry—just *resolved*. {target} dies to punctuation, not passion.",
        "The shiv does its job. The light in {target}'s eyes skips like a bad tape, then cuts out completely.",
        "The blade kisses {target} one last time, deep and fatal. Their knees buckle as if the world itself just gave out beneath them. The sound isn’t a scream. It’s a silence that sucks the heat from the room.",
        "It’s not clean, but it’s final. The shiv goes in and stays for a second, like it’s savoring the moment. {target} crumples without ceremony. The way they fall is final—there’s no poetry, just absence.",
        "{attacker} stabs and doesn’t stop. The blade saws, slips, sinks until {target} stops twitching. The floor will remember this. Blood pools, thick as oil. It carries the heat of a life just ended.",
        "A choke, a gurgle, and then silence. {target} falls in a heap that doesn’t resemble a person anymore. {attacker} steps over them like refuse. You can hear their last breath leaking out like a dying radiator.",
        "The wound is almost elegant, a single red bloom on a ruined canvas. {attacker} watches as {target} folds, the light going out behind their eyes. There’s a slump, a twitch, and then the kind of stillness you can’t fake.",
        "No screaming. Just wet breath and blood tapping out a rhythm on the tile. {attacker} breathes in deep. It smells like victory. The light in their eyes doesn’t fade—it *cuts out*, like a bad signal.",
        "The blade finds something vital. {target} gurgles, then collapses, a puppet cut from its strings. {attacker} steps back like they’re admiring their signature. You smell it—ozone and something underneath. Something human.",
        "It’s not a fight anymore. It’s an ending. The shiv disappears into {target} and when it leaves, so does the light in their eyes. The blade exits slower than it entered, dragging time with it.",
        "{attacker} buries the shiv up to the hilt. {target} spasms once, then stills, their blood spreading out like spilled ink on a floor full of bad decisions. No one says anything. There’s nothing to say that won’t rot in the throat.",
        "No scream. No theatrics. Just a wet sound, a sudden sag, and the unmistakable smell of someone being deleted from existence. It wasn’t murder. It was maintenance.",
        "{attacker} drives the shiv in with practiced rhythm, like they’ve done this a hundred times and plan to do it a hundred more. {target} doesn't even get a last word. Even the shiv seems quieter now, like it’s tasted satisfaction.",
        "The shiv enters and something in {target} leaves—something permanent. What’s left falls in on itself like a building condemned. The world shifts half a degree, like reality updated itself post-mortem.",
        "The shiv goes in. It stays for a moment — just long enough to whisper something only {attacker} can hear. Then it’s out. {target} isn't. The sound isn’t a scream. It’s a silence that sucks the heat from the room.",

        "The final blow isn’t fast — it’s precise. Surgical. {attacker} makes sure {target} remembers it all the way down. There’s a slump, a twitch, and then the kind of stillness you can’t fake.",
