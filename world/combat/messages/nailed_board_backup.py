        "A slow tilt reveals every rusty spike. {attacker} grips tighter. They’re not holding a weapon. They’re holding a decision.",
        "Each nail is different — crooked, rusted, pitted. {attacker} lifts them all at once, like a bouquet from hell.",
        "Each step echoes louder as {attacker} hefts the board. The nails are jagged, just like their grin.",
        "It's not balanced. It's not clean. But the moment {attacker} raises the nailed board, it becomes something holy and violent.",
        "No ceremony. Just nails. {attacker} lifts the board like it's firewood — but what they're burning is someone's future.",
        "No prep. No flourish. Just the board, the nails, and {attacker}'s eyes — empty and ready.",
        "The board clunks against the ground as {attacker} drags it behind them. The nails leave scratches. So will the swing.",
        "The board creaks as {attacker} shifts their grip. The nails shimmer with old blood and fresh malice.",
        "The board creaks. The nails click. {attacker} smiles faintly. This is going to get messy.",
        "The board leans against {attacker}'s shoulder. They tap it gently, like coaxing it to remember how it kills.",
        "The nails are bent, but they’ll still punch through flesh. {attacker} taps the board against their boot, testing its appetite.",
        "The nails aren’t uniform. That’s what makes them worse. {attacker} shifts the board until it feels balanced. Or lethal.",
        "The plank is crude, cracked, and reliable. {attacker} grips it with the steady calm of someone who intends to use every nail.",
        "The weapon has no symmetry. Just promise. {attacker} lets it swing low, dragging it behind like a shadow.",
        "The wood creaks ominously as {attacker} hoists it high. The nails look like a skyline of violence.",
        "The wood is soft from blood. The nails are not. {attacker} brings it to bear with practiced rage.",
        "The wood is stained, split, and cruel. {attacker} raises it with the ease of someone who’s used it before.",
        "There’s no flash. Just a dirty plank studded with rot and ruin. {attacker} holds it like justice. The mean kind.",
        "With a slow drag along the ground, the nailed board leaves a trail of scratches. {attacker} grips it with both hands. The violence is already implied.",
        "{attacker} breathes out slowly. The board rises. The nails seem to vibrate in the stale air.",
        "{attacker} hoists the splintered board, rusted nails jutting out like teeth. It’s not a weapon — it’s an accident waiting to happen. On purpose.",
        "{attacker} lifts the nailed board like it’s a relic. The wood groans. The nails do not.",
        "{attacker} lifts the weapon with care, like it might fall apart — or tear someone apart. Nails glint like promises.",
        "{attacker} raises the board slowly, letting everyone see the rusted metal, the dried blood, the certainty.",
        "{attacker} rests the board across one shoulder. It squeaks like an old door. One about to slam shut.",
        "{attacker} runs a finger along one nail. Blood beads. They smile like that’s the point.",
        "{attacker} slaps the board against their open palm. The nails glisten in dull red. Someone else's red.",
        "{attacker} spins the board once, chips of old blood flying off. It lands in both hands like an oath renewed.",
        "{attacker} spins the plank once, testing the weight, letting the rusty teeth whistle through the air.",
        "{attacker} swings the board in a slow arc, not to hit — just to show what comes next.",

    'hit': [
        "A backhanded swing slashes across the face. One nail lodges in the lip. The pain is unspeakable.",
        "A backhanded swipe splits {target}'s cheek wide open. The nails rake skin like meat hooks.",
        "A diagonal strike cuts across the chest. The nails tear cloth, flesh, and nerve endings alike.",
        "A downward strike crashes against {target}'s collarbone. The crunch is joined by a wet hiss of pain.",
        "A low sweep cracks {target}'s shin. The nails tear muscle and leave splinters behind.",
        "A nail drags across the jaw, leaving a torn line of pink and red. {target} screams with half a mouth.",
        "It doesn’t need power. The nails do the work. They punch through the thigh like paper and leave chaos behind.",
        "It’s not a clean hit — it’s better. Nails scrape and bite at awkward angles. {target} howls and staggers.",
        "One nail embeds just under the eye. {target} flails, howling, as blood blinds them.",
        "One nail punches into {target}'s neck, not deep but enough. Blood flows. Breath becomes effort.",
        "The blow cracks bone. The nails stay behind for half a second, as if unsure they want to leave.",
        "The board connects with {target}'s temple. One nail embeds. {attacker} pulls it free, slow enough to hurt.",
        "The board crashes across {target}'s upper back. They stumble forward, trailing torn skin and curses.",
        "The board hits knee. Bone cracks. {target} falls like scaffolding collapsing.",
        "The board slams into {target}'s gut. A nail sticks briefly, then rips free with something attached.",
        "The board smashes into {target}'s ribs. A nail catches and tears as it pulls back. The scream is instant and ugly.",
        "The board spins, catches {target} across the temple. Nails scratch the scalp, drawing blood like rain.",
        "The nails rake down {target}'s spine, not deep but wide. The scream is long, drawn out like the pain.",
        "The nails rake up the arm, tearing cloth and flesh in a shriek of sound. {target} drops what they’re holding.",
        "The plank lands hard across the chest. Nails puncture twice. Blood trails from three directions.",
        "The plank slams against {target}'s stomach. The nails catch fabric and skin — neither comes free cleanly.",
        "The swing catches {target}'s wrist. The crunch is followed by a spray of blood and a dropped weapon.",
        "{attacker} drives the board into {target}'s shoulder. The sound is wet. The pain, worse.",
        "{attacker} hooks the nails into {target}'s shoulder. They rip free with a slurping sound no one forgets.",
        "{attacker} jabs the plank forward like a spear. It lands in the ribs and leaves a new hole on the way out.",
        "{attacker} jams the board into the gut and twists. Nails dig in, tangle in cloth, and come back red.",
        "{attacker} plants their feet and slams the board forward. It hits ribs, bends inward, and breaks something important.",
        "{attacker} shoves the board into {target}'s side, pinning them briefly before wrenching it free with a snap.",
        "{attacker} swings low. The nails bite into {target}'s thigh and drag out red. The limp comes immediately.",
        "{attacker} swings with full weight. The nails leave trails across {target}'s arm like rusted signatures.",

    'miss': [
        "A bad angle. The swing misses, but the air tastes like rust anyway.",
        "A graze — close enough to smell rust. {target} is rattled but untouched.",
        "A low sweep misses, gouging the floor instead. Dust and rust scatter into the air.",
        "A mistimed lunge sends the board clattering off a crate. {attacker} pulls it free with a growl.",
        "A nail snags a coat but doesn’t find skin. {attacker} yanks the board back with a growl.",
        "A nail snags clothing but doesn't bite. The tear is audible. So is the breath that follows.",
        "A wild swing tears through a curtain, leaving smoking threads. {attacker} doesn't look — they're already turning.",
        "It misses. The tension doesn’t. The air buzzes where the swing was.",
        "The board arcs wide. The miss feels like a warning. {target} takes it seriously.",
        "The board catches on nothing, but the force behind it shakes the ground. {target} doesn’t smile.",

        "The swing hits empty space. The nails scream against wind, hungry and unsatisfied.",
        "The swing sails over {target}'s shoulder. Close enough that their skin tightens anyway.",
        "The weapon whistles by like a crude comet. {target} backs away, eyes wide, lucky for now.",
        "{attacker} overcommits, and the board glances off a wall. Sparks jump from rusted tips.",
        "{attacker} overshoots, the board thudding into the floor. The nails dig in — like they miss the taste.",
        "{attacker} swings too hard. The plank slams into a wall, sending splinters flying. The nails shake with rage.",
        "{attacker} swings wide, the board slapping against a steel door. The nails bend. Slightly. It doesn't matter.",
        "{attacker} swings, misses, and chips a chunk out of a nearby post. The nails glisten with intent.",
        "{attacker}'s aim is wild. The board carves through nothing, but it still feels violent.",
        "{target} ducks and the nails skim their hairline. No contact — just promise.",
        "{target} ducks. The nails miss, but the sound stays — a rusty whisper of what could’ve been.",

        "A strike to the back of the head ends the argument. {target} drops, blood pooling into stillness.",
        "A sweeping strike knocks {target} to their knees. The next embeds the nails in their spine. The fall is final.",
        "One nail pierces the heart. It wasn’t aimed. It just happened. {target} folds in half and doesn’t unfold.",
        "One nail punctures the eye. The body crumples before the scream even leaves the lungs.",
        "The blow catches {target} mid-breath. The nails cut off sound and life in one sickening gesture.",
        "The board crushes ribs, then lung. {target} gasps once and breathes out steam. Then nothing.",
        "The board lands atop the skull. Nails punch in deep and stay. {attacker} lets go. It holds itself.",
        "The board slaps across {target}'s jaw, and the nails do the rest. Teeth scatter like dice. Life flees.",
        "The final blow rakes across the chest. Nails drag until they find something vital — and end it.",
        "The final hit is low, cruel, and sharp. Nails rupture the neck. Blood pours like confession.",
        "The nailed board crashes into {target}'s skull. One nail buries deep. They drop mid-scream, twitching.",
        "The nails hit the throat and stay. {target} makes a sound like a clogged drain. Then collapses.",
        "The nails sink deep into the neck. When {attacker} pulls away, nothing moves but red.",
        "The plank crashes into the back of {target}'s head. They slump like strings were cut. Blood bubbles from the mouth.",
        "The plank lands like judgment. Three nails find the heart. The fourth? Just mean.",
        "The third strike is the kill. The board lands across the neck with enough force to fold the body like laundry.",
        "{attacker} brings the board down on {target}'s skull. The nails bury deep. The twitching stops before the board is pulled free.",
        "{attacker} buries the board in the gut and yanks upward. {target}'s body opens like a zipper.",
        "{attacker} drives the board into {target}'s throat. The nails tear through voice and artery. Silence follows.",
        "{attacker} hooks the board into {target}'s gut and *yanks*. What's left can’t be called alive.",
        "{attacker} slams the board into the face. The nose breaks, then the cheek, then everything. The silence after is pure.",
        "{attacker} smashes the board into {target}'s ribs, then again. The third strike leaves nothing but stillness.",
