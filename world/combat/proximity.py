Combat Proximity Management

Handles all proximity-related logic for the combat system.
Extracted from combathandler.py and CmdCombat.py to improve
organization and maintainability.

Functions:
- Proximity establishment and clearing
- Bidirectional proximity management
- Room-based proximity validation
- Proximity cleanup on movement
