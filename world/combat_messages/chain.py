        "{attacker} draws the chain from their belt with a sound like a zipper from hell. The metal links glint under dirty light.",

        "A snap of the wrist sends the chain into {target}'s shin. The sound is brittle. So is the stance.",
        "A spinning backhand wraps the chain around {target}'s arm. When it pulls away, the arm doesn’t lift again.",
        "A sudden twist wraps the chain around {target}'s neck — not tight enough to choke, but tight enough to scare.",
        "A tight, whipping motion lands the chain across the face. {target}'s eye swells instantly.",

        "A wild swing misses entirely, but the sound it makes echoes like a threat delayed.",
        "A wild swing sends the end of the chain whipping past {target}'s waist. The noise it makes is unforgettable.",
