        "{attacker} hefts the brick in one hand, testing the weight. It’s not elegant, but it doesn’t need to be.",
        "{attacker} pulls the brick from a coat pocket. It’s chipped, dirty, and exactly what this moment calls for.",
        "{attacker} raises the brick and lets it rest against their shoulder. It’s not a threat — it’s a promise.",
