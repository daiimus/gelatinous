        "{attacker} balances the handle across their shoulders, grinning beneath the weight of old labor repurposed.",
        "{attacker} drags the edge across the ground. Sparks follow. So does certainty.",

        "{attacker} hooks the shovel low and clips the knee. {target} crumbles with a grunt.",
        "{attacker} jabs low and hard. The blade strikes shinbone, and the sound isn’t right.",
        "{attacker} slams the blade into {target}'s stomach. It folds them like a dying book.",
