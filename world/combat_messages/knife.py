        "A flash of steel. That’s all {attacker} offers before stepping forward, knife low and ready.",
        "A flick of the wrist, and the blade appears. {attacker} steps closer with intent stitched into their stride.",
        "A glint of metal, then nothing. {attacker} makes the knife disappear until it’s needed. Which is now.",
        "A hiss of metal against sheath. That’s all it takes for {attacker} to let the knife start the conversation.",
        "A reverse grip. A slow breath. {attacker} holds the knife like a promise — and a threat.",
        "A small weapon for a personal job. {attacker} grips it like they’re writing a final sentence.",
        "It’s not big. It’s not loud. But in {attacker}'s hand, the knife becomes a conclusion.",
        "No speech. Just steel. {attacker} draws the knife with the calm of someone already decided.",
        "Steel meets hand. The connection is instinctive. {attacker} already knows how this ends.",
        "The blade glides through the air once, twice. {attacker} nods, satisfied. It’s sharp enough for what’s next.",
        "The blade is nicked and dark, like it remembers every time it tasted flesh. {attacker} smiles faintly.",
        "The blade is small, curved, and hungry. {attacker} twirls it once, then steadies their stance.",
        "The blade is ugly — pitted, chipped, unforgiving. {attacker} doesn’t mind. They prefer it that way.",
        "The edge glints once as {attacker} draws it slowly. There's no rush. There’s only inevitability.",
        "The edge is dull in places. That makes it hurt more. {attacker} seems to prefer it that way.",
        "The knife dances in {attacker}'s palm. It’s not nervous energy. It’s choreography.",
        "The knife is short, sharp, and personal. {attacker} holds it like a whisper meant to end arguments.",
        "The knife isn’t long. It doesn’t need to be. {attacker} lifts it with reverence.",
        "The weapon gleams with recent use. {attacker} doesn’t bother wiping it down. Why bother?",
        "The weapon’s size makes it look harmless. {attacker} knows better — and so will {target}.",
        "There’s no smile, no flair — just a flash of silver in {attacker}'s palm. The knife does all the talking.",
        "With one clean motion, {attacker} unsheathes the knife. The gleam on the edge is honest — and cruel.",
        "{attacker} draws the knife from their boot with a smooth, silent motion. It’s not showy — it’s certain.",
        "{attacker} draws the knife so smoothly it’s like it was always in hand, just waiting to be noticed.",
        "{attacker} flicks the knife into a reverse grip, holding it low and loose. The real grip is tighter — in their eyes.",
        "{attacker} flips the knife between fingers, blade flashing like a secret kept too long.",
        "{attacker} runs a cloth down the blade, slow and ceremonial. The knife doesn’t need cleaning. It needs remembering.",
        "{attacker} tightens their grip, the blade twitching in anticipation. It knows the way to bone.",
        "{attacker} tosses the knife once in the air. It spins too fast to follow. When it lands, everything goes quiet.",
        "{attacker} twirls the blade once, then lets it rest in a reverse grip. No flourish. Just intent.",

        "{attacker} carves a shallow cut across the cheek. The line is clean. The message, clearer.",
        "{attacker} carves down the forearm. The grip fails. The pain does not.",
        "{attacker} feints left, then slips the blade across the ribs. {target} winces, bleeding already.",
        "{attacker} jabs the knife upward into the gut. {target} doubles over and stays there.",
        "{attacker} jams the knife into the thigh and pulls sideways. Red floods the ground.",
        "{attacker} slashes across the collarbone. The cut is shallow — but the pain is not.",
