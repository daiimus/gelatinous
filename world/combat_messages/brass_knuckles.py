    'initiate': [
        "A low grunt. A breath. Then {attacker} steps forward, the sound of knuckles clinking together the only herald needed.",
        "A tilt of the head. A subtle inhale. Then brass meets bone — not yours, not yet, but soon. The dance is already starting.",
        "Each finger slides through the cold brass like a whisper made of violence. {attacker} doesn’t smile. That would imply joy.",
        "In that moment, the silence breaks. Not with sound, but with tension. Brass is ready. {attacker} is ready.",
        "No blades, no theatrics. Just fists and a reason. And brass, cold as the streetlight glare across their knuckles.",
        "No threat, no warning — just the sound of brass sliding against skin as {attacker} prepares to speak the only language they know. Their hands become history, their eyes a promise: someone is leaving this encounter differently than they arrived.",
        "No words. Just that metallic clink as {attacker} tightens the fit of the knuckles. Violence doesn’t wait for permission.",
        "Nothing theatrical. Just {attacker} standing there, hands clenched, the brass dull and worn, like it's been through a hundred exits.",
        "One ring at a time, the knuckles slide into place. The sound is soft metal, but it thuds in the chest like a threat.",
        "The air seems to change as {attacker} raises their hands. No blade. No flash. Just fists wrapped in the cold shine of brass and an aura that says they’ve ended things with less.",
        "The brass clinks as {attacker} rotates their wrist. Not flashy. Not elegant. Just deliberate — like punctuation at the end of a sentence.",
        "The ritual is in the silence. No speech, no flourish — just metal sliding into place, and a look that dares you to blink.",
        "The room feels smaller when {attacker} raises their fists. The air, heavier. The future, shorter.",
        "The weapon doesn't gleam; it *absorbs* the light. {attacker}'s fingers curl inward, and suddenly the space between you feels thinner.",
        "The weight isn’t in the weapon. It’s in the decision. {attacker} makes it without flinching.",
        "There’s no satisfaction in their eyes — just focus. The brass fits snug, like it remembers what it’s here to do.",
        "There’s no theatricality, no bravado. Just a practiced rhythm: clink, clink, clink — brass on bone. {attacker} exhales, low and steady, and the space around them tightens like a drawstring bag around intent.",
        "There’s something reverent about the way they prepare. Not sacred — just methodical, brutal, and resolved.",
        "They don’t draw a blade. They make a fist — a fist heavy with history and edged in metal. {attacker} is ready.",
        "With a low exhale, {attacker} fits the brass over their fingers like they were born with it. The past returns, cold and ready.",
        "With slow precision, {attacker} tightens the straps on the brass knuckles. Every movement speaks of memory — and muscle.",
        "You see the knuckles before you see the intent. {attacker} rolls their shoulders, and something quiet inside them snaps into focus.",
        "{attacker} cracks their knuckles — flesh against metal, a promise made audible. There's no flash of steel, just the dull gleam of pain made personal.",
        "{attacker} cracks their neck and slides the brass knuckles on with a solemn kind of ritual. Not flashy — just final.",
        "{attacker} doesn't brandish — they embody. The brass is part of them now, an extension of consequence.",
        "{attacker} doesn’t posture. They just raise their fists like it's a reflex. Like the world is something that needs punching back.",
        "{attacker} draws a slow breath as they slip the brass knuckles onto their fingers, one ring at a time. The sound is dull, metallic — the echo of old violence being rehearsed. Their knuckles flex with ceremony, not showmanship. This isn't just about pain. It's about *intention*.",
        "{attacker} exhales like they’ve been holding their breath for years. The knuckles are just punctuation on a very old sentence.",
        "{attacker} gives no speech, no flair — just a quiet calm and a glint of brass that says everything words could ruin.",
        "{attacker} moves like someone who’s done this too many times. No excitement. Just inevitability and metal in motion.",
        "{attacker} rolls their fingers into a ball, testing the weight. The brass hums with muscle memory and old grudges.",
        "{attacker} rolls their neck with a soft pop and slides the brass into place like a relic returned. You can feel the weight of memory in the way they tighten their fist — this isn’t the first time they’ve buried their past in someone else's face.",
        "{attacker} rotates their wrist, the brass gleaming like old teeth. The sound echoes louder than it should.",
        "{attacker} slides the brass knuckles onto their fingers like slipping into old habits. Each finger locked in, each joint an omen.",
        "{attacker} steps forward with purpose. The brass is worn, etched with hairline cracks — like it’s done this before. Like it wants more.",
        "{attacker}'s hands flex once, twice. The brass glints like old teeth in the dark. This isn't posturing — it's prelude.",
    ],
    'hit': [
        "A clean shot to the cheek snaps {target}'s head sideways. Their body follows, eventually.",
        "A left-right combo that ends with brass to temple. {target} sags like a book slammed shut mid-sentence.",
        "A short jab, perfectly placed. {target}'s head snaps sideways like a marionette whose strings were yanked by a god.",
        "A short, vicious jab connects with {target}'s nose. Blood erupts in a sharp spray, painting their teeth in red regret.",
        "Blood sprays from {target}'s nose as the knuckles bury themselves in flesh. They look stunned, like betrayal just hit them in the face.",
        "Brass scrapes bone as the fist drags across {target}'s brow. They flinch, then crumble.",
        "Knuckles crash into {target}'s jaw, and something gives — maybe a tooth, maybe time itself. Either way, they won't forget it.",
        "Knuckles drive through resistance. {target}'s breath explodes out, along with something more vital.",
        "Knuckles meet jaw and the result is immediate — {target}'s head whips sideways, a fine mist of spit and red trailing behind like punctuation. There’s a beat, a stagger, and the dull thud of knees losing faith.",
        "No wasted motion — just the brutal truth of metal meeting skull. {target} blinks, then sways, then drops to a knee.",
        "The blow crunches into {target}'s face. For a moment, everything pauses. Then the blood starts.",
        "The blow isn't clean — it scrapes, digs, *sticks*. When {attacker} pulls back, there's a smear of blood across the brass like a signature. {target} stumbles, and the floor suddenly feels too far away to trust.",
        "The brass slams into the side of {target}'s head with blunt finality. They reel like they forgot how legs work.",
        "The fist collides with {target}'s chest like a hammer. Their feet stay still. Everything else lurches.",
        "The hit lands like a bad secret finally spoken. {target} reacts like they’ve heard it before — but never this loud.",
        "The hit leaves something behind. Not just bruises, but awareness. {target} knows now what they're dealing with.",
        "The punch doesn't lift {target} off their feet — it sinks them down, like gravity decided they were done standing.",
        "The punch lands like a statement — final, declarative. {target}'s body reacts before they can, lurching backward with the grace of a collapsing shelf. For a moment, the room forgets how to breathe.",
        "The punch lands with the sound of a cinder block hitting meat. {target} stumbles, dazed, as blood jumps from their mouth in a red arc.",
        "The punch sinks into {target} with a sound like a rotten wall caving in. {target} staggers, eyes wide, breath gone.",
        "The sound is dull but wet — a kind of hush. {target} drops their guard, their breath, and finally their knees.",
        "The sound is sick and heavy. The damage is heavier.",
        "The sound isn't theatrical. It’s real. It’s the crack of violence made personal.",
        "The strike comes from nowhere. Brass, bone, and gravity find consensus in {target}'s stomach.",
        "There's a crunch, sick and final, as {attacker}'s fist connects with {target}'s cheekbone. Bone and brass argue. Brass wins.",
        "You can feel it through the floor — a low thud, a muffled collapse. {attacker} doesn’t stop to admire it.",
        "{attacker} drives a hook into {target}'s ribs, the brass sinking in like a grudge. Bone strains beneath the impact, and {target} lets out a sharp exhale — not pain, but *surprise*. They weren’t ready for this kind of honesty.",
        "{attacker} drives brass into ribs, again and again, each strike sounding more like punishment than strategy.",
        "{attacker} drives their fist into {target}'s ribs, and the sound is less 'punch' and more 'collapse.' Breathing becomes optional.",
        "{attacker} lands a hook that crumples {target}'s mouth into a jagged shape. Something white flies — tooth or lie.",
        "{attacker} slams their fist into {target}'s sternum with a sound like breaking furniture. The brass amplifies the blow, turning flesh into percussion. {target} doubles over, coughing something dark onto the floor — blood or resolve, it doesn’t matter. Both are leaking.",
        "{attacker}'s fist drives into {target}'s solar plexus. The sound is dry and wrong. Breathing becomes optional.",
        "{attacker}'s follow-through is textbook — wrist firm, elbow tight. The brass hums with impact. {target} slumps against the blow like it explained something to them.",
        "{attacker}'s punch lands flush with {target}'s jaw. There’s no drama — just consequence and a spray of blood.",
        "{attacker}'s strike is almost surgical. Almost. But the blood running down {target}'s face makes it look more like performance art.",
        "{attacker}'s uppercut lifts {target} just slightly, like punctuation to a long conversation that just ended.",
    ],
    'miss': [
        "A blur of motion, a flash of brass — but {target}'s instincts hold. The strike lands on shadow.",
        "A mistimed jab flies past {target}'s head. The punch doesn't land, but the message still does.",
        "A swing and nothing more. {attacker} doesn't flinch. They've missed before. They'll correct.",
        "Brass misses bone by a whisper. {target} exhales too late to feel relief.",
        "The brass slices the air, but {target} is already leaning back. Timing saves skin.",
        "The fist whips by, whistling its promise unfulfilled. {attacker} doesn't flinch — they’ll try again.",
        "The punch carves through the silence but finds no flesh. {attacker}'s expression doesn't change, but the slight recoil in their stance says it all — they weren't just swinging. They were committing.",
        "The punch lands in empty space. The silence that follows is somehow louder.",
        "The punch whips past {target}'s ear. Close enough to count hairs. Too close to count on that luck again.",
        "The strike misses by inches, but the threat lingers like smoke. {attacker}'s follow-through is still poetry.",
        "The swing is sharp, practiced, but still wrong. {target} shifts low, and the knuckles pass inches from their face. You can almost hear the sigh of relief that never quite reaches their lungs.",
        "The swing misses, but {attacker}'s stance resets instantly. They’re not here for flourishes. They’re here to erase.",
        "{attacker} lunges forward but {target} twists just out of range. The knuckles flash by like a warning dressed in brass.",
        "{attacker} lunges with force, momentum dragging the blow too far. {target} slides past, breath catching in their throat, mind already recalculating how many more of those they can afford to dodge.",
        "{attacker} overcommits, their knuckles slicing the tension but not the flesh. {target}'s smirk doesn’t last.",
        "{attacker} steps in too far, overshooting. {target} pivots, eyes wide, and lives to regret it later.",
        "{attacker} swings wide, the brass catching nothing but air and frustration. {target} breathes a little harder, a little faster.",
        "{attacker} throws a haymaker that finds only wind and bad intentions. {target} stares, heart pounding.",
        "{attacker} throws a jab meant to end things, but {target} pivots just out of range. The brass slices air, leaving behind nothing but tension and the promise of a closer miss next time.",
        "{attacker} throws a punch meant to end the argument. Instead, it just rewrites the opening line.",
        "{attacker}'s fist cuts through the space where {target} was a heartbeat ago. Close enough to feel the air shift.",
        "{attacker}'s strike carves a line through the air — close, precise, and utterly ineffective.",
        "{target} ducks just in time, the metal brushing past their temple like a whisper with bad intentions.",
        "{target} leans back just far enough for the knuckles to miss. No cheer, no relief — just the knowledge of how close it came.",
        "{target} reels back and the brass knuckles graze the edge of their collar. It's not a hit, but it's not comfort either. Both of them now know how narrow that margin is.",
    ],
    'kill': [
        "A hook to the side of the head ends the debate. {target} collapses into themselves like a question answered too late.",
        "A last uppercut snaps {target}'s head back. It stays there for a moment, as if trying to detach. Then it all comes down.",
        "A straight shot to the temple. Lights out. No encore.",
        "Brass crashes into temple. {target}'s legs give out, arms limp. They fold like a blueprint someone stopped believing in.",
        "Brass slams into spine. {target}'s body folds inward like a bad plan under pressure.",
        "It’s not rage — it’s ritual. The punch is slow, final, full of silence. {target} offers no resistance to the dark.",
        "It’s not the punch that kills — it’s the fall, the angle, the way {target}'s skull meets the curb afterward. Brass just lit the fuse.",
        "No scream. No flailing. Just a twitch, a slump, and a red smear across the floor that won’t ask for explanation.",
        "No scream. No theatrics. Just a hard, efficient end — brass into throat, collapse into stillness. {attacker} doesn’t gloat. They just exhale, letting the silence finish the sentence they started.",
        "No theatrics. No wind-up. Just brass, velocity, and inevitability. {target} won’t be getting back up.",
        "One last blow — brutal and merciful in equal measure. {target} hits the ground before the echo fades.",
        "One last hit to the ribs. {target} wheezes, coughs, and drops. The pool that spreads is the punctuation.",
        "One last punch, low and upward, catches {target} under the jaw. The sound is sick, wet, intimate. Their eyes roll back, and they crumple like a paper model doused in regret.",
        "The blow lands so clean it feels rehearsed. {target} doesn’t scream. They just stop being part of the fight.",
        "The brass punches through the moment, and suddenly {target} isn't there anymore. They’re a shape on the floor, mouth open, eyes wide, the final breath caught somewhere between surprise and inevitability.",
        "The crunch of bone, the spray of blood, and then stillness. The scene exhales.",
        "The final blow is delivered with no fanfare — just brass meeting temple in a clean, echoing note of collapse. {target}'s body goes rigid, then slack, as though the string suspending them from life has finally snapped.",
        "The final blow is short, ugly, and complete. {target}’s breath stops trying. Their body agrees.",
        "The final punch lands square on {target}'s jaw. There’s a sharp sound, then nothing. They fall in silence, eyes open, soul gone.",
        "The final punch lands with a sound that makes the air recoil. {target} crumples like scaffolding losing faith in architecture.",
        "The final punch leaves {target} sagging. Not dead yet, but beyond return. Their eyes say what their lungs can’t.",
        "The hit doesn't kill immediately. It's the fall — the way {target}'s skull hits the concrete like a gavel.",
        "The hit lifts {target} slightly before the drop. For a moment they float — then they’re just wreckage.",
        "The knuckles hit with a wet crunch, and {target}'s lights go out. Not like a switch. Like a fusebox flooded.",
        "The punch lands so hard it rewrites {target}'s posture. They fold inward, then fall outward, a puppet with cut strings.",
        "The punch lands, {target} drops, and everything else in the world keeps moving — like they were never there.",
        "The strike is clean, final, and horrible. {target} drops with a slack-jawed expression that reads like an unfinished sentence.",
        "{attacker} buries their fist in {target}'s throat. The gasp is wet and short. The silence after is clinical.",
        "{attacker} doesn’t even breathe hard. They just withdraw their fist from the ruin of {target}'s face and let gravity do the rest.",
        "{attacker} hits hard enough to silence a thought mid-formation. {target} doesn’t even finish falling before the lights go out.",
        "{attacker} steps back as {target} falls, letting gravity and brass write the ending together.",
        "{attacker}'s fist buries deep into {target}'s temple. There's no scream, just a twitch, then silence. Heavy. Permanent.",
        "{attacker}'s fist connects with surgical malice. The brass comes back red. {target} doesn’t come back at all.",
        "{attacker}'s fist connects with {target}'s throat. The sound they make isn’t human. Then there’s no sound at all.",
        "{attacker}'s knuckles dig into the side of {target}'s skull, and something inside gives way. The light leaves their eyes not as a flicker, but as a retreat — swift, permanent, and uncaring.",
    ],
