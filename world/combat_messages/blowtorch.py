        "A long-held breath escapes as {attacker} lights the torch. The flame is blue, almost gentle — until it touches flesh.",
        "A quick twist, a spark, and the flame snarls awake. {attacker} watches the fire like it's a pet they've starved.",
        "Fuel flows. Flame follows. {attacker} gives the nozzle a half-turn, and the blowtorch roars awake like a small sun.",
        "It’s not the flame that’s scary. It’s how calm {attacker} is as they adjust it.",

        "The torch clicks, flares, and steadies into a whispering cone of heat. {attacker} steps forward without a word.",
        "The torch ignites with a bark of flame. {attacker}'s hand is steady, their expression unreadable.",
        "The torch sputters once, then catches. {attacker} adjusts the nozzle with care, tuning the flame like a surgeon — or a killer.",
        "The torch sputters, then steadies. {attacker} narrows their eyes and tips the flame upward like it’s a lantern in the underworld.",
        "There's no ceremony. Just the hiss of fuel and the sharp kiss of ignition. The blowtorch purrs, ready to sear.",
        "With a flick and a click, {attacker} brings the blowtorch to life. The sputtering flame steadies into a clean cone of heat.",
        "With a flick of steel on steel, {attacker} lights the torch. The flame leaps forth like it’s been waiting.",
        "{attacker} checks the nozzle, lights the flame, and watches it flicker. The torch doesn’t need to be loud. It just needs to be close.",
        "{attacker} holds the canister steady, twisting the valve open until the blue fire blooms like a mechanical flower.",
        "{attacker} ignites the torch with a snap of flint, the flame jittering at first, then forming into a narrow cone of vengeance.",
        "{attacker} keeps the flame low, close to the ground. The blue tip flickers with anticipation.",
        "{attacker} kneels briefly, shielding the torch from the wind. When it lights, it’s like the room exhales in fear.",
        "{attacker} leans in slightly, adjusting the flame until it spits with sharp intensity. They aren’t heating pipes. They’re ending days.",
        "{attacker} lights the torch, tilting it like they’re testing the heat of judgment. The air distorts around it.",
        "{attacker} raises the canister and sparks the torch in a single practiced move. The flame dances. The room recoils.",
        "{attacker} shakes the canister briefly, testing pressure. The flame emerges sharp, tight, impatient for a victim.",
        "{attacker} thumbs the igniter, and a low hiss of gas fills the air. The flame flares into life — blue, angry, precise.",
        "{attacker} twists the nozzle slowly, letting the hiss of gas grow louder before lighting the torch. The flame bursts to life like a secret too long kept.",
