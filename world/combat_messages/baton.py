        "A flick of the wrist brings the baton to full length. It doesn’t make a sound — but the tension it draws does.",
        "A slow grip, a fast pull — and the baton extends with purpose. {attacker} doesn't grin. But the corners of their eyes tighten.",
        "A small smile creeps across {attacker}'s face as they draw the baton. There’s no fear in that gesture — only confidence.",
        "It clicks into place like a puzzle snapping shut. {attacker} leans forward slightly. The baton doesn’t demand attention — it commands it.",
        "No blade, no edge — just steel and leverage. {attacker} takes a step forward, baton loose at their side like a promise not yet broken.",
        "The baton is simple, direct — just like {attacker}. They raise it slowly, deliberately, and lock eyes with {target}.",
        "The baton isn't dramatic, but it doesn’t need to be. {attacker} raises it like a question that already knows the answer.",
        "The baton isn’t meant to impress. It’s meant to end arguments. {attacker} brings it into view without ceremony.",

        "The metal rod extends with a click that sounds louder than it should. {attacker}'s grip tightens around it like they’re remembering something.",
        "The weapon appears as if from nowhere. One second {attacker}'s hands are empty, the next they're holding finality.",
        "There’s a brief moment where nothing happens. Then — snap. The baton is ready. So is {attacker}.",
        "There’s a practiced grace to {attacker}’s movement — a predator pulling a fang from its sheath. The baton gleams in the low light.",
        "There’s no ceremony. Just a steel rod and the calm certainty of someone about to make a point no one will forget.",
        "They don’t draw it fast. They draw it deliberately. Like lighting a fuse.",
        "With a half-step forward, {attacker} clicks the baton open and lowers their center of gravity. The dance is starting.",
        "With a practiced gesture, {attacker} twirls the baton once and brings it to rest across their shoulder. The intent is clear — this won’t be subtle.",
        "{attacker} cracks the baton once against their palm. It’s not to test it — it’s to *warn you*.",
        "{attacker} doesn’t speak. They just pull the baton from their belt and give it a single spin. The air changes with that motion.",
        "{attacker} draws the baton with a slow, deliberate motion. It unfolds with a metallic click, and suddenly the conversation has changed.",
        "{attacker} draws the baton with a swift flick of the wrist. It extends with a satisfying snap, like punctuation at the end of a threat.",
        "{attacker} flexes their wrist. The baton answers with a stiff metallic growl. It’s awake now.",
        "{attacker} flicks their wrist and the baton springs open, sleek and dark. It hums with stored violence.",
        "{attacker} gives the baton a lazy twirl before resting it against their shoulder. Their expression doesn’t change — the weapon speaks for them.",
        "{attacker} pulls the baton from a loop at their side, extends it with a flick, and tests its balance like they’ve done this before. Many times.",
        "{attacker} rolls their wrist, testing the baton’s weight. It's not for show — it’s to remember how it feels before blood touches it.",
        "{attacker} spins the baton once, a lazy motion that ends in a tight grip. The way they hold it says: you’re out of chances.",
        "{attacker} unclips the baton and snaps it open with a flick that echoes off the walls. It sounds like the start of a countdown.",

        "A quick upward thrust catches {target} under the chin. Their head snaps back. Their knees buckle.",
        "A rising blow from below the jaw knocks {target}'s head back. Blood arcs. Silence follows.",

        "A spinning strike lands clean across {target}'s jaw. They spin once, then drop like a failed experiment.",
        "It hits with the sound of a gavel — decisive, cold, irreversible. {target} collapses as if judged.",
        "It’s a short jab, right to the gut — but it lands like a truck. {target} doubles over and doesn’t get back up.",
        "It’s not flashy — it’s efficient. {attacker} delivers a brutal jab to the sternum. {target} stumbles, stunned and sagging.",
        "One blow to the hand — and then another to the elbow. {target} screams. The baton makes its argument clearly.",
        "One step inside the guard, one twist of the hip, and the baton slams into {target}'s abdomen. A spray of spit follows.",

        "The baton finds temple. {target} stumbles sideways, blood already trickling from an unseen break.",
        "The baton isn’t heavy, but it’s fast. It lands three times before {target} even starts to fall.",

        "The baton lands behind {target}'s knee, sending them crashing down in a tangle of limbs and disbelief.",

        "The baton snaps across {target}'s ribs with a whip-crack that silences the room. They wheeze and fold, breath stolen.",
        "The baton whistles through the air before finding the side of {target}'s jaw. A tooth skips across the floor like a pebble.",
        "There’s no wind-up, just impact — the baton slams into {target}'s shoulder with a crunch that bends posture and resolve.",
        "{attacker} delivers a sharp jab to the gut, the baton driving deep. {target} doubles over, eyes wide, mouth open but silent.",
        "{attacker} doesn’t break stride — just drives the baton into {target}'s stomach and keeps walking.",
        "{attacker} drives the tip into {target}'s solar plexus. The air leaves their lungs in a ragged gasp. They fold without grace.",
        "{attacker} jabs into the throat, a precision hit that leaves {target} clawing at nothing. Their eyes say everything their voice can’t.",
        "{attacker} plants their foot and spins, the baton trailing like a tail of vengeance. It strikes {target} behind the ear. Hard.",
        "{attacker} uses the baton like a punctuation mark, striking {target} mid-sentence. Words become blood.",

        "A crack against the wall echoes through the space. {attacker} doesn’t flinch — they’re already adjusting.",
        "A downward smash shatters a light fixture instead. The burst of sparks frames {attacker}'s next move.",

        "A lunge, a sweep — but nothing lands. {attacker} adjusts instantly, already swinging again.",
        "A sharp jab misses by inches. The baton thuds into nothing, but the momentum still carries meaning.",
        "A wide arc misses completely. {attacker}'s momentum carries them forward. The correction will be brutal.",

        "The swing is sharp but early. The baton carves wind instead of flesh. {target} feels lucky for once.",
        "The swing misses, but the echo doesn’t. {target} can still feel the strike they avoided.",
        "{attacker} jabs forward, but {target} sidesteps with a stumble. The near miss feels earned — barely.",

        "{attacker} swings fast, but {target} shifts sideways. The baton bounces off metal, sending sparks skyward.",
        "{attacker} swings too wide, the baton cutting air like an accusation. {target} reels back just in time.",

        "A sharp twist of motion delivers the baton straight to the jaw. The neck snaps. The body collapses. The scene ends.",
        "A single upward jab under the chin collapses the airway and snaps the spine. {target}'s legs give out without resistance.",
        "It’s not the first hit that kills — it’s the third. Repeated trauma until stillness is the only sound left.",

        "The baton lands one final time, center mass. {target} gasps, chokes, and collapses like a puppet released.",
        "The baton lands with such force that {target}'s skull caves inward. No blood spray, just collapse — instant and terminal.",
        "The baton lands with such force that {target}'s spine audibly separates. Their last sound is breath exiting permanently.",
