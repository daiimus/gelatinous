        "A guttural sound fills the room as the saw turns over. It doesn’t want to start — it *needs* to.",
        "A single rev makes the air vibrate. {attacker} tilts their head, like they're listening for the exact moment fear begins.",
        "A single rev sends exhaust and fury pouring into the air. {attacker} steps forward like they’re beginning a confession.",
        "Each rev of the chainsaw is a threat made flesh. {attacker} wields it like it’s not just for cutting — it’s for rewriting reality.",
        "Fuel drips, smoke rises, and {attacker}'s smile sharpens. The chainsaw joins the moment like a second mouth ready to scream.",
        "Fumes roll out like prophecy. The saw screeches into life and {attacker} steps forward like a sermon’s about to begin.",
        "Grease-stained fingers wrap around the throttle. The first pull is stubborn. The second makes the world pay attention.",
        "It doesn’t start pretty — the chainsaw chokes and sputters, but then it *howls*. {attacker} smiles like they missed that sound.",
        "It takes a few false starts, but then it kicks — the engine snarling awake like a starving dog catching scent.",
        "No warmup, no speech. Just a blast of noise and the unmistakable scent of gasoline as {attacker} brings the beast online.",
        "Smoke coils around {attacker} like a halo of ash. The chainsaw growls against the silence, hungry and without restraint.",
        "The air thickens as {attacker} revs the saw once, twice. Sparks spit from the teeth as they lock eyes with {target}. There’s no subtlety here — only declaration.",
        "The blade spins, but it’s the look in {attacker}’s eyes that freezes everyone. The saw is a tool. {attacker} is the intent.",
        "The chainsaw jerks in {attacker}'s grip, motor sputtering smoke. The sound alone feels like it's scraping your nerves raw.",
        "The chainsaw jerks violently as {attacker} pulls the cord. It growls awake like something buried too long under asphalt and regret.",
        "The chainsaw starts with a shriek like tortured metal. {attacker} doesn't flinch — this isn't noise, it's a ritual. One they’ve practiced before.",
        "The cord snaps back hard and the chainsaw roars to life. {attacker} doesn’t look at {target} — the machine does.",
        "The engine barks and sputters, stalling once before coming alive. {attacker}'s shoulders settle like they’ve returned to something familiar.",
        "The first pull fails. The second catches. The third makes the air itself recoil from the shriek of spinning teeth.",
        "The first rev is for intimidation. The second is for rhythm. The third? That one’s for {target}.",
        "The machine coughs, stutters, then bellows like something alive and angry. {attacker} gives it a rev — not to test it, but to warn the room.",
        "The saw starts with a scream that could wake the dead. {attacker} looks like they *want* it to.",
        "The silence before the engine starts is worse than the roar itself. {attacker} breaks it with a pull, and something *hunts*.",
        "The sound of the starter cord is followed by chaos. {attacker} doesn't flinch. This is the language they speak best.",
        "The world doesn't get quieter. It gets *louder*. The saw cuts through stillness like it wants more than wood.",
        "There’s a pause before ignition — a prayer, maybe. Then the chainsaw erupts into sound, and {attacker}'s grin stretches like an open wound.",
        "There’s no hesitation. Just fuel, steel, and the steady growl of a monster that {attacker} wakes like they’ve done it a hundred times before.",
        "There’s something wrong with the way it starts — uneven, snarling, feral. {attacker} doesn’t mind. They prefer it unhinged.",
        "This isn't about intimidation — it's about inevitability. The engine growls like a throat full of gravel as {attacker} hoists it high.",
        "With one sharp tug, the silence is murdered. The chainsaw sputters, catches, and fills the air with mechanical rage.",
        "{attacker} cradles the chainsaw like a sacred relic. The switch flips. The roar begins. The room exhales in dread.",
        "{attacker} doesn't shout. The chainsaw does it for them — a howl of fuel, steel, and blood not yet spilled.",
        "{attacker} doesn’t rush. They let the motor warm like a predator stretching. The blade idles with menace.",
        "{attacker} grips the handle like a holy relic. The engine kicks into life, and the chains begin to spin in prayer.",
        "{attacker} grips the saw with reverence, the engine sputtering like a failing heart before catching with a violent scream.",
        "{attacker} hauls the massive engine into motion, fuel sloshing, blade lurching to life with a sound that cleaves the moment in two.",
        "{attacker} jerks the cord and the world becomes loud. The teeth spin like they’re starving, and everything else seems made of meat.",
        "{attacker} yanks the cord and the chainsaw roars like a thing reborn. Smoke curls from its throat like it remembers fire.",
        "{attacker} yanks the starter cord with a guttural jerk. The chainsaw sputters, coughs, then roars to life in a cloud of smoke and intent. It doesn’t hum — it *screams*.",
        "{attacker}'s grip tightens. The pull is fast, decisive. The chainsaw sputters — then ignites into a mechanical scream that fills the room.",
        "{attacker}'s shoulders rise with effort as the saw jerks to life. The blade spins like a curse being recited out loud.",

    'hit': [
        "A glancing blow becomes a tearing ruin. {attacker} pulls back, and what comes with the blade doesn’t belong outside the body.",
        "A horizontal sweep tears open a gash across {target}'s gut. Blood splashes hot against steel and keeps dripping long after the blade moves on.",
        "A quick slice becomes something more. {target} collapses mid-sentence, blood painting punctuation around their last word.",
        "A spray of red arcs into the air as {attacker} drives the saw into {target}'s shoulder. The sound is wet, grinding — unforgettable.",
        "A vertical plunge opens {target} from clavicle to sternum. The wound screams even if they don’t.",
        "Chainsaw teeth rake across {target}'s ribs, dragging sparks and fluids in equal measure. The roar drowns out the agony.",
        "It catches {target} in the thigh, spinning them to the ground. They try to crawl. The saw has other ideas.",
        "It connects with {target}'s spine and vibrates like a tuning fork. The scream dies mid-breath.",
        "It doesn't go in clean. It *grinds*, catching on ribs, dragging. {target} bucks like the body wants to flee itself.",
        "It hits and stays there, teeth chewing deeper. {target}'s resistance falters, buckling under the brutal thrum.",
        "It hits at an angle. Not clean. Not kind. The saw chews and {target} shrieks, dancing with death they didn’t invite.",
        "One side of {target} caves in under the churning chain. The body doesn’t break — it *melts* around the motion.",
        "One slash, from shoulder to hip. {target} collapses mid-turn, blood trailing behind them like punctuation.",
        "Steel roars against bone. {target} crumples, twitching, as the saw finishes its sentence.",
        "Teeth meet body, and the world becomes red static. {target} convulses as the chainsaw chews its way through resistance.",
        "The blade clips {target}'s arm, spraying red in tight spirals. They try to clutch it. There’s nothing left to clutch.",
        "The blade sinks in and {target} howls, twisting as pieces of them don’t keep up. The chainsaw doesn't cut — it devours.",
        "The chain bites and sticks. {attacker} wrenches it free, taking a ribbon of flesh that will never be reattached.",
        "The chainsaw kisses {target}'s shoulder and keeps going. The scream is short — there’s too much damage for sound.",
        "The chainsaw punches into {target} like a fist full of monsters. The shriek that follows isn’t just theirs — it belongs to the saw.",
        "The engine dips as it grinds bone, but {attacker} holds steady. The saw doesn’t care what’s in its way — only that it’s soft.",
        "The saw bites into {target}'s side, ripping through cloth, flesh, and composure. Screams drown under the roar of steel on meat.",
        "The saw catches {target} along the ribs, the engine lurching as it tears through resistance. The blood isn’t a spray — it’s a curtain.",
        "The saw doesn't just cut — it *removes*. Flesh peels, muscle splits, and {target}'s balance disappears with their composure.",
        "There's a smell — ozone, blood, hot oil. {attacker} smells it too. It's the scent of something unmade.",
        "There's no finesse. {attacker} simply leans in, letting the saw do the talking. And it talks in syllables of ruin.",
        "There’s a moment where the blade sticks — then a jolt, and it’s free again, trailing flesh behind it like a streamer.",
        "{attacker} carves a crescent into {target}'s flank. The teeth drag muscle with them like souvenirs.",
        "{attacker} carves a deep, ragged line across {target}'s back. The engine snarls with satisfaction as skin peels like cheap wallpaper.",
        "{attacker} doesn't hesitate. The chainsaw carves into flesh like a drunk god drawing new commandments.",
        "{attacker} drags the saw upward through {target}, spine sparking on the teeth. It smells like burned meat.",
        "{attacker} follows through as the saw tears down the centerline. The damage isn’t a wound — it’s a statement.",
        "{attacker} grinds the saw into {target}'s thigh, shredding meat into vapor. The smell is thick, unmistakable.",
        "{attacker} plants a boot into {target} and drives the saw in deep. The result is chaos — bone crunching, nerves firing, everything screaming.",
        "{attacker} pushes the blade into {target}'s gut, slowly, deliberately. They don’t scream — they *wail*.",
        "{attacker}'s strike lands center mass. The saw buckles, catches, and explodes forward, taking {target}'s balance with it.",
        "{target} staggers as the saw hits home. For a second, they look surprised — then the blood surges up and surprise turns to collapse.",
        "{target} tries to dodge, but the edge catches them across the ribs. The scream is guttural. The smell is copper and smoke.",
        "{target} turns too late. The saw greets them with a full-throated growl and a mouthful of shoulder.",
        "{target}'s scream is swallowed whole by the motor. Their body jerks as the chain digs, sputters, and *eats*.",

    'miss': [
        "A failed strike, but the message lands. {attacker}'s next move promises less mercy.",

        "A mistimed lunge sends {attacker} spinning, saw roaring wild. {target} watches, heart racing, legs ready to betray.",
        "Air is all it finds, but it *tastes* like flesh. {attacker} doesn’t let go of that thought.",
        "It’s a near miss, but near doesn’t matter with teeth like those. The air still smells like terror.",
        "No contact — just momentum and noise. {target} doesn’t flinch, but their heart races.",
        "The blade chews empty air, kicking sparks against the floor. {target} stumbles back, mouth open in silent thanks.",
        "The blade cuts the space where breath used to be. {target} holds theirs and doesn’t exhale.",
        "The blade hits nothing, but the sound shreds the silence. {target}'s knees threaten to buckle anyway.",
        "The blade misses, but the *presence* doesn’t. {target}'s breath catches as the noise claws at their nerves.",
        "The chain rips through air, howling for blood it didn’t find. {target} hears that sound in their bones.",
        "The chain spins, but it catches nothing but wind. {attacker} resets, lips tight, engine shrieking in protest.",
        "The chain spins, but the aim betrays them. {attacker}'s expression doesn’t change. They weren’t swinging to win — they were swinging to warn.",
        "The chainsaw howls but finds no victim. The sound is the only injury — for now.",
        "The chainsaw slices through shadow, lighting nothing but the room on fire with tension. {attacker} keeps moving.",
        "The floor vibrates with the missed strike. {target} stays upright, but their thoughts spiral.",
        "The miss is loud, jagged, wrong. {attacker}'s stance resets with eerie calm.",
        "The saw bites into a doorframe, flinging splinters everywhere. {attacker} rips it loose, already turning back.",
        "The saw bites into drywall instead, throwing up dust and sparks. {target} stumbles away, coughing relief.",
        "The teeth flash past {target}'s shoulder, close enough to slice their coat. The noise still rings in their ears.",
        "There’s a screech, a scrape — and then stillness. {attacker}'s eyes burn brighter than the motor.",
        "{attacker} brings the saw around, but it finds only wall. Sparks fly. The room hisses.",
        "{attacker} brings the saw down hard — too hard. It sticks in the ground for a breath. {target} takes that breath and runs.",
        "{attacker} lunges too far, the saw's weight pulling them off balance. {target} slips aside like a rumor.",
        "{attacker} overcommits — the saw tearing into nothing but air and echo. {target} backs away, still tasting fear.",
        "{attacker} swings the chainsaw in a wide, screaming arc. It misses by inches, but the wind carries menace.",
        "{attacker} swings the saw in a wide arc, but {target} ducks. The roar lingers. The threat remains.",
        "{attacker}'s swing is slow and wide, theatrical even. {target} steps out of reach, but the sound follows them.",
        "{attacker}'s swing is wild, rage overriding aim. {target} rolls past, too aware of how lucky they just became.",
        "{target} stumbles back, eyes wide as the saw brushes their coat. Close enough to taste the fuel in the air.",
    ],
    'kill': [
        "A downward slam splits {target} in two clean halves — clean in shape only. The result is obscene, unrecognizable.",
        "A final push and the teeth find heart. {target}'s body seizes, then stills, their mouth open but empty.",
        "It isn’t the cut that kills — it’s the refusal to stop. {attacker} doesn’t stop. Not until the saw runs clean.",
        "It’s fast — faster than it should be. The engine stalls halfway through, but {target} is already gone.",
        "No elegance, no ceremony. Just carnage. {target}'s end is a smear and a sound that won't stop echoing.",
        "One clean drive, no hesitation. The saw stays in {target} for a moment longer than it needs to.",
        "One last roar, one last bite — and {target} becomes part of the floor.",
        "One last swing, and the saw carves through {target} like wet rope. The blood coats {attacker}, warm and unapologetic.",
        "The blade enters between shoulder and throat. By the time it exits, {target} is already a memory.",
        "The chain chews its way through {target}'s torso, pulling organs into daylight. Their feet leave the floor.",
        "The chain hits vertebrae and keeps going. {target}'s body drops in segments, no longer part of a single story.",
        "The chainsaw embeds into {target}'s skull with a sickening crunch. When it’s over, there’s nothing left to identify.",
        "The chainsaw enters at the neck and exits at the pelvis. What’s left is meat and echo.",
        "The chainsaw plunges through {target}'s torso with a sickening crunch. They don’t fall — they *disintegrate*.",
        "The chainsaw tears through {target}'s chest, blood arcing high in a final salute. Their collapse is less a fall than a surrender.",
        "The cut is diagonal, disrespectful. {target} falls in two directions, their blood trying to hold them together.",
        "The kill is ugly. Violent. Honest. {target} dies knowing what they were up against — and that it didn’t care.",
        "The kill isn’t clean. It’s cruel. {target} twitches, then stops, the saw still humming beside them.",
        "The saw finds {target}'s neck and keeps going. What’s left isn’t a wound — it’s a border between life and never again.",
        "There’s a sound like snapping wood. {target}'s body folds in half, steam rising from the ruin.",
        "There’s no slow motion. Just a jolt, a crunch, and {target} gone. Erased by noise.",
        "There’s no time to scream. Just steel through spine, and {target} collapsing like scaffolding in a fire.",
        "With a full-body shove, {attacker} drives the blade in deep. {target} seizes, then vanishes beneath the noise.",
        "With one final rev, {attacker} buries the blade in {target}'s sternum. The scream ends before the motor does.",
        "{attacker} drags the saw across {target}'s chest and doesn’t stop. There’s no final scream — just static.",
        "{attacker} drives the chainsaw into {target}'s chest, leaning in like they’re pushing through a heavy door. Blood erupts, spraying across everything with no mercy.",
        "{attacker} plants the blade and lifts. What’s left of {target} slaps against the floor with a sound that won’t be forgotten.",
        "{attacker} plunges the blade into {target}'s gut and lifts. The body arcs, spasms, then goes slack, steaming and silent.",
        "{attacker} steps in close and plunges the blade down. The sound is thunder. {target}'s scream doesn’t even reach the ceiling.",
        "{target} is torn apart mid-step, the saw catching them in full stride. Their momentum carries them nowhere but down.",
