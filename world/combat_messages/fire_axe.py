        "A lazy spin flips the axe into position. {attacker}'s posture says dance. The axe says death.",
        "A single breath in. The axe rises. {attacker}'s knuckles go white — the moment has already begun.",
        "No warm-up. No warning. The axe is in {attacker}'s hands, and the balance of power just shifted.",
        "The axe is heavy, and {attacker} lifts it like it's part of them. There’s no need for words. The weight says everything.",
        "The axe swings low as {attacker} drags it from the dirt. It hums — not from power, but from anticipation.",
        "The blade catches the light, and for a second it looks like it’s burning. {attacker} doesn’t blink.",
        "The blade is chipped and stained, notched by time. {attacker} lifts it like a relic handed down from ruin.",
        "The blade isn't sharp — it's *willing*. {attacker} hoists it onto their shoulder like it’s part of their soul and burden both.",
        "The dull red of the axe head still shows soot stains from another life. {attacker} raises it high, like they’re trying to resurrect something awful.",
        "The fire axe doesn’t shine. It absorbs the light, dull and wet-looking. {attacker} hefts it like it’s owed something.",
        "The fire axe is hoisted not with anger, but with certainty. {attacker} isn’t hoping to win. They’ve already decided.",
        "The fire axe isn’t elegant, and neither is {attacker}. They don’t try to intimidate. They just *prepare*.",
        "The fire axe rests on {attacker}'s shoulder. The silence stretches thin. Everyone knows what comes next.",
        "The way {attacker} adjusts their grip says this isn’t their first swing. The blade gleams. So do their teeth.",
        "The wood creaks in their hands as the axe rises. This isn’t precision. It’s tradition.",
        "The wood handle creaks under {attacker}'s grip. It remembers being swung. So does the crowd.",
        "There’s no ceremony. Just the screech of boots, the swing of hips, and that red crescent of steel hanging in the air.",
        "There’s no rush in {attacker}'s motion — just intent. The axe rises. So does dread.",
        "There’s weight in the room now — a gravitational pull around {attacker}. The axe is the center of it.",
        "With a crack of knuckles and a grunt of muscle, {attacker} pulls the axe from the wall. Dust scatters. The air gets colder.",
        "With a slow breath and a sharp twist of the wrists, {attacker} brings the fire axe into view. It’s not lifted — it’s unveiled, like something sacred and ruinous.",
        "{attacker} drags the blade along a wall as they approach. The metal squeal announces them louder than any scream.",
        "{attacker} exhales, then tightens their grip. The axe doesn’t whistle — it waits. Waiting is worse.",
        "{attacker} grips the fire axe by the worn wooden handle, testing its weight like a promise about to be kept. The blade glints under the light, already hungry.",
        "{attacker} lifts the fire axe slowly, reverently, like a holy relic exhumed for one last sermon. The weight is memory. The edge, prophecy.",
        "{attacker} rests the blade against their collarbone, eyes locked on {target}. The message is clear. The warning, over.",
        "{attacker} rolls their neck, loosening joints with casual cruelty. The fire axe dangles from one hand, heavy and inevitable.",
        "{attacker} rolls their shoulder once, twice. The axe swings low, then high. It’s not practice. It’s prelude.",
        "{attacker} spits to the side and tightens their grip. The axe rises like a question nobody wants answered.",
        "{attacker} steps forward, one boot at a time, dragging the axe along the floor. Sparks trail behind them like breadcrumbs for the damned.",

    'hit': [
        "A cleave to the thigh severs not just flesh, but mobility. {target} drops to one knee, disbelief painted in crimson.",
        "A downward cleave crashes through {target}'s shoulder and stays. {attacker} lets go. The axe holds itself now.",
        "A low swing catches {target} across the gut. Blood fountains. Their knees buckle as if even their body knows what comes next.",
        "A quick, rising swing lands in the gut. {target} folds, then drops, their insides trying to catch up to the blade.",
        "A sharp strike to the shoulder severs more than muscle. {target}'s arm drops — and so does their will.",
        "A sideways swing catches {target} across the ribs. They stagger like someone unplugged their spine.",
        "A vertical swing lands square on {target}'s collarbone. There’s a wet crack — and then screaming.",
        "Blood mists the air as the edge bites into {target}'s leg. They scream and stumble, dragging red across the floor.",
        "It hits with the sound of demolition. {target}'s chest caves, and for a moment their body forgets how to stand.",
        "It lands hard — not fast. The edge crunches bone and everything behind it. {target}'s cry is short-lived, smothered in red.",
        "It’s not the edge but the weight that ruins {target}. They’re struck flat, breath gone, ribs shattered.",
        "Steel bites deep, lodging into flesh before {attacker} pulls back hard. {target} falls, clutching what’s left.",
        "Steel meets spine, and the sound is unforgettable. {target} jerks forward and collapses in half-silhouette.",
        "The axe bites through muscle like wet cloth. {target} chokes on blood and disbelief as {attacker} pulls back with something more than strength.",
        "The axe connects with brutal, direct force. There’s no finesse. Just raw correction.",
        "The axe hits the thigh and doesn’t stop. {target} screams as bone yields with a reluctant snap.",
        "The axe slams into {target} with a noise that’s more *impact* than sound. Something inside them gives way.",
        "The axe tears through layers of clothing, skin, and purpose. {attacker} doesn’t look away. They *watch it happen.*",
        "The blade finds purchase in {target}'s collar. It doesn't stop. The path it carves is messy, wet, and final.",
        "The blade sinks in, lodging for a second before {attacker} tears it free. {target} screams. The echo is worse.",
        "The blow shatters bone, flips {target} sideways, and leaves behind a wound wide enough to whisper through.",
        "The impact sends {target} reeling, blood leaping in arcs across the wall. It looks like a crime scene already.",
        "The sound isn’t metal on flesh — it’s metal through flesh. {target}'s scream trails the blade’s exit.",
        "{attacker} buries the axe in {target}'s side. It takes a twist to dislodge. The spray that follows is arterial and blinding.",
        "{attacker} buries the blade into {target}'s side, wrenching it free with a spray of blood and a sickening twist.",
        "{attacker} carves through clothing, skin, and willpower in one clean motion. {target} reacts like something broke inside — because something did.",
        "{attacker} doesn't hesitate — they cleave into {target} with the weight of a decision made long ago.",
        "{attacker} drives the axe down into {target}'s shoulder. The joint caves with a squelch and a crunch, like collapsing scaffolding.",
        "{attacker} drives the axe in low, into the gut. The wound bubbles before the blood does.",
        "{attacker} twists as they swing, driving the weight of the axe into {target}'s ribs. Something snaps. Everything else follows.",
    ],
    'miss': [
        "A chair splinters instead. {attacker} pulls the blade loose without looking at the debris.",
        "A hiss of motion and then nothing. The axe misses, but it rewrites the tension anyway.",
        "A miss, but the aftermath still feels like trauma. {target}'s ears ring. Their legs don’t feel like theirs anymore.",
        "A near miss, but the wind from the swing sends a chill through the room. {target} flinches anyway.",
        "A swing, a scream of metal — and then stillness. {attacker}'s eyes remain fixed, their stance never breaking.",
        "It doesn’t connect, but it *communicates*. {target}'s next movement is faster. And smaller.",
        "It misses, but not by much. {target}'s breath catches in their throat. {attacker}'s grin doesn’t waver.",
        "Steel scrapes concrete as the swing lands wide. Sparks fly. {attacker} doesn’t stop moving.",
        "The axe cleaves through shadow. The noise lingers like a warning — or a rehearsal.",
        "The axe crashes into a steel girder instead, sparking in protest. {attacker}'s snarl says this wasn’t over — it was practice.",
        "The axe kisses the floor where {target}'s foot stood a moment ago. The ground doesn’t bleed — this time.",
        "The axe shears through furniture instead. Wood explodes. {attacker} barely notices.",
        "The blade bites into a table instead, sending fragments scattering. {attacker} yanks it free with fury in their eyes.",
        "The blade comes down like judgment, but {target} scrambles out of reach. The impact leaves a crater where a body should be.",
        "The blade whistles past {target}'s head, carving the air but not the flesh.",
        "The fire axe cuts nothing but space. But the space feels different now. Tense. Ready to bleed.",
        "The follow-through is brutal, but it’s empty. The axe lands nowhere, the threat still heavy in the air.",
        "The miss lands like a warning shot across time. {target} swears they saw their own ending in the motion blur.",
        "The red blade arcs through the room like punctuation — but the sentence doesn’t land.",
        "The strike was too high, too wide. {target} flinches anyway — the wind off the blade was enough to shift fate.",
        "{attacker} grits their teeth as the axe thunks harmlessly into a wall, splinters exploding outward.",
        "{attacker} overextends, and {target} retreats. Not victory — just delay.",
        "{attacker} swings so hard it spins them halfway around. The axe hits nothing, but fear fills in the gaps.",
        "{attacker} swings too wide, the axe dragging sparks as it kisses the floor beside {target}'s feet.",
        "{attacker} swings with the full force of inevitability — and hits only silence. The axe whistles its frustration.",
        "{attacker}'s momentum betrays them, the blade whirling past with enough heat to make {target}'s skin twitch.",
        "{attacker}'s swing is too slow, too telegraphed. {target} ducks, eyes wide, heart louder than the steel.",
        "{attacker}'s wide arc cuts through air, silent but deafening. {target} blinks, not believing they’re still whole.",
        "{target} ducks, boots sliding across concrete. The axe swings overhead, trailing menace like smoke.",
        "{target} sidesteps, boots slipping slightly, but it's enough. The axe tears through space where they were a breath ago.",
    ],
    'kill': [
        "A clean slice through the throat ends {target}'s involvement. Their body lurches. Their head doesn't.",
        "A final swing from {attacker} splits {target}'s torso in two jagged halves. The scream starts, then chokes on its own blood.",
        "A full-bodied swing ends in contact. {target} folds like wet cardboard, their insides made public.",
        "It lands like punctuation. The axe enters below the jaw, exits behind the ear. {target} simply ends.",
        "One blow. That’s all. The axe lands in the side of {target}'s neck and doesn’t come out clean. Nothing about this is clean.",
        "One final swing connects and sends {target} spinning like a marionette in a fire. They don't get back up.",
        "One hard blow from overhead. {target}'s spine snaps like rotted wood. Their collapse is permanent.",
        "One last swing opens {target} from hip to shoulder. They stumble, then collapse like a puppet set on fire.",
        "The axe crashes down, lodging into {target}'s spine. They freeze, then crumple, limbs failing all at once.",
        "The axe embeds in {target}'s skull and stays. The body drops like a discarded idea, blood painting the floor in spirals.",
        "The axe enters with resistance, then slides through like a confession. {target} drops, blood blooming beneath them.",
        "The axe lands in a downward slam, splitting {target}'s skull like fruit. Red and bone scatter in a cruel bouquet.",
        "The axe lands with a sickening finality, splitting {target}'s skull clean down the center. They fall in silence, their scream stolen mid-birth.",
        "The blade embeds in the spine. {target} jerks once, then hangs there like punctuation.",
        "The blade finishes what fear started. {target} collapses into a heap of breathless apologies.",
        "The blade sinks in and stays there, half-buried in ribs and regret. {target} drops with a noise that sounds like surrender.",
        "The cleave catches {target} at the hip. Their top half turns before the bottom knows it’s over.",
        "The cut isn’t deep — it’s decisive. {target} hits the ground hard, their eyes already empty.",
        "The edge drives through {target}'s throat, cleaving halfway down. They don’t even hit the ground cleanly.",
        "The final blow catches {target} in the face, erasing features and expression alike. It’s not a death — it’s a red exclamation mark.",
        "The sound is wet and final. {attacker} yanks the blade free from {target}'s ribcage with a grunt and no ceremony.",
        "The strike caves in {target}'s chest with a sound that flattens the room. What's left gurgles and collapses.",
        "There’s no elegance — just a vertical cleave that splits {target} like bad wood. They never even get a last word.",
        "With a roar, {attacker} buries the blade deep into {target}'s chest. The engine of their breath halts instantly.",
        "{attacker} brings the axe down in a diagonal arc that splits {target} from shoulder to lung. They crumple mid-turn, the breath still in their mouth.",
        "{attacker} doesn't flinch as the axe cleaves {target} from collar to belt. The moment after is quieter than it should be.",
        "{attacker} doesn’t even look angry. Just focused. The blow lands with exact brutality, and {target} ends mid-motion.",
        "{attacker} heaves the axe into {target}'s sternum. It doesn't just wound — it opens. What was inside, no longer is.",
        "{attacker} swings low and wide, severing {target}'s legs at the knees. They drop like meat, already gone.",
        "{attacker}'s swing cleaves into the side of {target}'s head. The skull folds like rotten fruit. There's no time for last words.",
