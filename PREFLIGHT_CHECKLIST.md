## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Settings Changes

### Before Testing, Verify:

**1. AUTO_PUPPET_ON_LOGIN = False** ‚úÖ (Fixed)
- **Why**: Prevents auto-puppeting before character creation menu runs
- **Location**: `server/conf/settings.py` line 79
- **Status**: Changed from `True` to `False`

**2. START_LOCATION = "#2"** ‚úÖ (Added)
- **Why**: Default spawn location for new characters
- **Location**: `server/conf/settings.py` line 82
- **Status**: Added (defaults to Limbo)

**3. MULTISESSION_MODE = 1** ‚úÖ (Already set)
- **Why**: Account-based login with character selection
- **Location**: `server/conf/settings.py` line 75

**4. AUTO_CREATE_CHARACTER_WITH_ACCOUNT = False** ‚úÖ (Already set)
- **Why**: We handle character creation custom
- **Location**: `server/conf/settings.py` line 78

## üß™ Testing Prerequisites

### Before First Test Run:

1. **Server Restart Required** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   ```bash
   evennia reload
   # or
   evennia restart
   ```
   - Settings changes require server restart
   - New command module needs to be loaded

2. **Check Splattercast Channel Exists**
   ```python
   # In-game:
   @py from evennia.comms.models import ChannelDB; ChannelDB.objects.get_channel("Splattercast")
   ```
   - Character creation system logs to Splattercast
   - Death system logs to Splattercast

3. **Verify Limbo (#2) Exists**
   ```python
   # In-game:
   @py from evennia import search_object; print(search_object("#2"))
   ```
   - START_LOCATION points to #2
   - Fallback location if custom room not set

4. **Test Account with No Characters**
   - Need a fresh account OR
   - Archive all existing characters for test account
   ```python
   # Archive all characters for account:
   @py self.account.characters.all().update(db_archived=True)
   ```

## üéØ Test Scenarios

### Test 1: First Character Creation Flow
**Objective**: Verify first-time character creation works

**Steps**:
1. Log in with account that has no characters
2. Should immediately see character creation menu
3. Enter first name (test validation: too short, too long, special chars)
4. Enter last name (test uniqueness check)
5. Select sex (male/female/androgynous)
6. Distribute GRIM points:
   - Try `grit 100`
   - Try `resonance 50`
   - Try `reset`
   - Try `done` before reaching 300 (should fail)
   - Distribute to 300 total
   - Try `done` (should succeed)
7. Confirm character creation
8. Should spawn in START_LOCATION with welcome message

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Character created with correct name
- ‚úÖ GRIM stats match distribution (total 300)
- ‚úÖ Sex correctly set
- ‚úÖ Character spawned in correct location
- ‚úÖ clone_generation = 1
- ‚úÖ archived = False
- ‚úÖ Stack ID created

**Validation Commands**:
```python
@stats
@examine me
```

---

### Test 2: Death and Respawn Flow
**Objective**: Verify death ‚Üí character creation ‚Üí respawn works

**Steps**:
1. Have a character (from Test 1 or create manually)
2. Set custom desc/longdesc for testing inheritance:
   ```
   @desc me = A weathered clone with tired eyes.
   @longdesc/head This clone's face shows signs of previous trauma.
   ```
3. Kill the character (use admin command or medical system)
4. Wait 6 minutes for death progression to complete
5. Should see unpuppet message in Splattercast
6. Should see character creation menu with 3 templates + flash clone
7. Note the 3 template names and GRIM distributions
8. Select option 4 (flash clone)
9. Should see name incremented (e.g., "John Doe" ‚Üí "John Doe II")
10. Should spawn with inherited stats

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Old character unpuppeted
- ‚úÖ Old character archived with reason="death"
- ‚úÖ 3 random templates shown with 300 GRIM each
- ‚úÖ Flash clone shows old character name and stats
- ‚úÖ New character has incremented Roman numeral
- ‚úÖ New character inherits: GRIM, desc, longdesc, sex
- ‚úÖ clone_generation incremented
- ‚úÖ death_count incremented
- ‚úÖ Same Stack ID preserved
- ‚úÖ previous_clone_dbref points to old character

**Validation Commands**:
```python
@stats
@examine me
@py print(f"Generation: {self.db.clone_generation}, Deaths: {self.db.death_count}")
@py print(f"Stack ID: {self.db.stack_id}")
@py print(f"Previous: {self.db.previous_clone_dbref}")
```

### Test 3: Template Selection
**Objective**: Verify template selection works

**Steps**:
1. Kill character again (or use test account)
2. In respawn menu, select option 1 (first template)
3. Note the template's name and GRIM stats
4. Select sex
5. Confirm creation
6. Check character stats match template

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Character created with template name
- ‚úÖ GRIM stats match template exactly
- ‚úÖ Sex correctly set
- ‚úÖ clone_generation = 1 (new identity)
- ‚úÖ No Stack ID from previous character

---

### Test 4: Name Validation
**Objective**: Verify name validation works

**In first character creation:**
1. Try names too short: "A" ‚Üí should reject
2. Try names too long: "A" * 31 ‚Üí should reject
3. Try special characters: "John@Doe" ‚Üí should reject
4. Try numbers: "John123" ‚Üí should reject
5. Try existing name: (name of another character) ‚Üí should reject
6. Try profanity: "Fuck Smith" ‚Üí should reject
7. Try valid name: "John Doe" ‚Üí should accept

---

### Test 5: GRIM Distribution Validation
**Objective**: Verify GRIM validation works

**In first character creation:**
1. Try `grit 0` ‚Üí should reject (min 1)
2. Try `grit 151` ‚Üí should reject (max 150)
3. Try `grit 100`, `resonance 100`, `intellect 100`, `motorics 100` ‚Üí total 400, `done` should reject
4. Try `grit 1`, `resonance 1`, `intellect 1`, `motorics 297` ‚Üí total 300, `done` should accept

---

### Test 6: Re-login After Character Creation
**Objective**: Verify at_post_login handles existing characters

**Steps**:
1. Have a character created
2. Quit game (`@quit`)
3. Log back in
4. Should auto-puppet last character (no menu)

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ No character creation menu
- ‚úÖ Automatically puppeted into last character
- ‚úÖ Character state preserved

---

### Test 7: Multiple Deaths (Roman Numeral Incrementation)
**Objective**: Verify Roman numerals increment correctly

**Steps**:
1. Create character "Test Subject"
2. Kill and flash clone ‚Üí "Test Subject II"
3. Kill and flash clone ‚Üí "Test Subject III"
4. Kill and flash clone ‚Üí "Test Subject IV"
5. Continue to test higher numerals

**Expected Roman Numerals**:
- I ‚Üí II ‚Üí III ‚Üí IV ‚Üí V
- IX ‚Üí X ‚Üí XI
- XIX ‚Üí XX ‚Üí XXI

---

## üêõ Known Issues to Watch For

### Potential Bugs:
1. **EvMenu not exiting properly** - Menu might stay open after character creation
2. **Session lost during creation** - Disconnect during menu might orphan character
3. **Template generation extremes** - Random templates might be unbalanced
4. **Roman numeral parsing** - Edge cases with existing numerals
5. **Duplicate name race condition** - Two accounts creating same name simultaneously

### Debug Commands:
```python
# Check active handlers
@py from evennia.scripts.models import ScriptDB; print(ScriptDB.objects.filter(db_key="combat_handler_script"))

# Check character state
@py print(f"Archived: {self.db.archived}, Death count: {self.db.death_count}")

# Check account characters
@py print(self.account.characters.all())

# Force character creation menu
@py from commands.charcreate import start_character_creation; start_character_creation(self.account, is_respawn=False)

# Archive current character
@py self.db.archived = True

# Check Stack ID
@py print(self.db.stack_id)
```
