# Phase 2.4 Wound System - Dynamic Location Conversion Summary

## Overview
Successfully converted the wound description system from hardcoded location mappings to a fully dynamic system that leverages Evennia's flexible medical architecture.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dynamic Location Mapping (`constants.py`)
- **Removed**: Static `LOCATION_DISPLAY_MAP` dictionary with hardcoded locations
- **Added**: `get_location_display_name(location)` function that handles any anatomy
- **Benefit**: Works with custom anatomies and non-standard body types

### 2. Organ-Based Wound Detection (`wound_descriptions.py`)
- **Removed**: Hardcoded condition checking (`character.ndb.medical_conditions`)
- **Added**: Dynamic organ damage state checking via medical system
- **New Functions**:
  - `_determine_injury_type_from_organ(organ_name)`: Maps organ to injury type
  - `_determine_wound_stage_from_organ(organ_state)`: Maps damage state to healing stage
  - `_determine_severity_from_damage(damage_level)`: Maps damage to severity
- **Benefit**: Integrates properly with existing medical system architecture

### 3. Flexible Anatomy Support (`longdesc_hooks.py`)
- **Updated**: `get_standalone_wound_locations()` uses `character.longdesc.keys()`
- **Updated**: All functions now work with character's actual anatomy
- **Benefit**: Supports any body type or anatomy configuration

### 4. Dynamic Location Priority (`longdesc_integration.py`)
- **Removed**: Hardcoded location priority dictionary
- **Added**: `get_location_priority()` function with flexible location matching
- **Benefit**: Works with any location names using substring matching

### 5. Clean Module Exports (`__init__.py`)
- **Removed**: Duplicate imports and exports
- **Updated**: Export `get_location_display_name` instead of `LOCATION_DISPLAY_MAP`
- **Benefit**: Clean API for importing wound system components

## Technical Benefits

### Flexibility
- Works with any character anatomy (humans, creatures, robots, etc.)
- Supports custom body types without code changes
- Adapts to existing medical system configurations

### Integration
- Properly leverages existing medical system architecture
- Uses organ damage states instead of separate wound tracking
- Integrates with longdesc system's anatomy definitions

### Maintainability
- No hardcoded anatomy assumptions
- Single source of truth for location naming
- Easy to extend for new anatomies

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Same API)
```python
from world.medical.wounds import get_wound_description

# Still works the same way
description = get_wound_description(
    injury_type="bullet",
    location="chest", 
    severity="Moderate",
    stage="fresh"
)
```

### Dynamic Location Display
```python
from world.medical.wounds.constants import get_location_display_name

# Works with any location name
display_name = get_location_display_name("left_wing")  # "left wing"
display_name = get_location_display_name("tentacle_3")  # "tentacle 3"
```

### Organ-Based Wound Detection
```python
# Now automatically detects wounds from medical system
# No need to maintain separate wound lists
wounds = get_character_wounds(character)  # Reads from medical organs
```

## Backwards Compatibility
- All existing APIs work the same way
- No changes needed to calling code
- Automatic fallbacks for edge cases

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with standard human anatomy
2. Test with custom creature anatomies
3. Verify organ damage states map correctly to wound descriptions
4. Test location priority with non-standard location names
5. Validate longdesc integration with various body types

## Next Steps
- Integration testing with actual medical system
- Performance testing with complex anatomies
- Documentation updates for custom anatomy setup
