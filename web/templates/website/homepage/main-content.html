    Welcome to Gelatinous Monster, an <a href="https://github.com/daiimus/gelatinous" target="_blank">in-development</a> 
    online text-based multiplayer game set in an offworld colony where death is more inconvenience than ending. 
    You're a freelancer. Digitally immortal, physically disposable. Operating on the fringe and traversing in-between disposable "sleeves" 
    (bodies, for the uninitiated). You chase contracts, financial security, and whatever else passes for meaning 
    in a place where resurrection is just another service industry.

    You are the gelatinous monster. Not the sleeve - that's just meat and water, a seventy-percent solution 
    of saline and bad decisions wrapped in skin. The real horror is <i>you</i>: the ghost in the machine, 
    the pattern that persists, the signal refusing to degrade. You pour yourself into these bodies like 
    consciousness is just another bodily fluid, and when they fail - you simply 
    find another vessel. Another sleeve. Another temporary arrangement of atoms pretending coherence.
</p>

<p>
    The colony doesn't care what you are. It barely cares <i>that</i> you are. Out here past the edge of 
    polite civilization, identity is as fluid as the water that comprises most of your stolen biology. 
    Take contracts. Make enemies. Die spectacularly. The sleeve can be replaced. The question is: 
    can you?
