DiscourseConnect Session Sync

This view redirects a logged-in Django user to Discourse to establish a proper
browser session with cookies. Simply redirecting to /session/sso triggers the
SSO flow which logs the user into Discourse.

Setup:
1. Configure settings in server/conf/secret_settings.py:
   DISCOURSE_URL = 'https://forum.example.com'
   DISCOURSE_SSO_SECRET = 'your-sso-secret-here'

2. Link to this view (opens in same tab, redirects through SSO):
   <a href="{% url 'discourse-session-sync' %}">Visit Forum</a>

How it works:
- User clicks link and is redirected to Discourse /session/sso
- Discourse initiates DiscourseConnect SSO flow back to Django
- Django's discourse_sso view authenticates and returns user data
- Discourse creates browser session with cookies
- User is redirected to Discourse home page, logged in

This is the proper way to establish a Discourse session from Django.
When auth_immediately=true, this happens automatically without user prompt.
