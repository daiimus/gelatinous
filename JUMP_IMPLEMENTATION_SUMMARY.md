# Jump Command Implementation - Commit Summary

## Overview
Complete implementation of the Jump command system with three distinct mechanics:
- Explosive sacrifice (heroic damage absorption)
- Edge descent (tactical repositioning) 
- Gap jumping (aerial transit with sky rooms)

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- `commands/combat/movement.py` - Added CmdJump class (~450 lines)
- `commands/combat/cmdset_combat.py` - Added CmdJump to combat cmdset
- `world/combat/constants.py` - Added DEBUG_PREFIX_JUMP constant
- `specs/JUMP_COMMAND_SPEC.md` - Updated with implementation status and sky room architecture

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Explosive Sacrifice
- `jump on <explosive>` syntax
- Complete damage absorption (hero takes all, others take none)
- Proximity inheritance from explosive
- Timer cleanup and chain reaction prevention
- Integration with existing grenade system

### 2. Edge Descent  
- `jump off <direction> edge` syntax
- Motorics skill checks vs configurable difficulty
- Property-driven exit configuration (`exit.db.is_edge = True`)
- Combat escape mechanics (like flee command)
- Fall damage on failure

### 3. Gap Jumping
- `jump across <direction> edge` syntax  
- Sky room transit system (no dynamic creation/deletion)
- Multi-strategy room lookup (tags, properties, bidirectional)
- Fall room system for failures
- 2-second transit delay with immersive messaging

## Architecture Decisions

### Sky Room System
- **No Dynamic Creation:** Uses pre-existing rooms only
- **Multiple Lookup Strategies:** Tag-based, property-based, bidirectional
- **Graceful Fallback:** Direct movement if no sky room configured
- **Future XYZ Ready:** Sky rooms become normal traversable rooms

### Property-Driven Configuration
```python
# Exit properties
exit.db.is_edge = True
exit.db.is_gap = True  
exit.db.edge_difficulty = 8
exit.db.gap_difficulty = 10
exit.db.fall_room = crash_site

# Sky room properties
sky_room.db.origin_room = rooftop_a
sky_room.db.destination_room = rooftop_b
sky_room.tags.add("sky_room", category="room_type")
```

### Integration Points
- Combat handler (remove from combat on successful jumps)
- Proximity system (establish relationships for sacrifice)
- Grappling system (prevent jumps while grappled)
- Grenade system (rigged grenade checks, auto-defuse)
- Aim system (clear aim states on movement)

## Testing Status
- ✅ Parsing logic tested (all syntax variants)
- ✅ Integration points verified
- ✅ Error handling implemented
- ✅ Logging comprehensive
- ⏳ Live testing pending

## Ready for Live Testing
The implementation is architecturally sound and ready for live testing. All integration points are in place, error handling is comprehensive, and the system gracefully handles missing configurations.

Recommended test sequence:
1. Basic syntax parsing (`jump on`, `jump off`, `jump across`)
2. Explosive sacrifice with active grenades
3. Edge descent with/without proper exit properties
4. Gap jumping with/without sky rooms configured
5. Integration with combat, grappling, and grenade systems
