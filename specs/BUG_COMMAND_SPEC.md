# Bug Command Specification

## Overview

The `@bug` command allows players and staff to submit bug reports directly to the GitHub repository as issues. This integrates in-game feedback with the development workflow while maintaining appropriate privacy boundaries.

**Current Status**: ✅ **Production Ready** - All planned features implemented and deployed.

## Features

- **@bug**: Interactive workflow for creating detailed bug reports with title, category, and description
- **@bug/list**: View the 10 most recent bug reports from GitHub
- **@bug/show <number>**: View full details of a specific bug including all comments (supports `#15` format)
- **Rate Limiting**: 30 reports per player per day
- **Privacy-Conscious**: No email addresses or sensitive player data exposed
- **GitHub Integration**: Issues automatically created with proper formatting and labels

## Design Principles

1. **Accessible**: All players can report bugs
2. **Privacy-Conscious**: No email addresses or sensitive player data exposed
3. **Context-Rich**: Captures technical environment for debugging
4. **Generous Rate Limiting**: Players can report up to 30 bugs per day
5. **Developer-Friendly**: Issues created with proper formatting and labels

---

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
commands/
  CmdBug.py          # New command implementation
  default_cmdsets.py # Add CmdBug to default cmdset

server/conf/
  secret_settings.py # Store GITHUB_TOKEN (gitignored)
```

### GitHub API Integration

**Endpoint:**
```
POST https://api.github.com/repos/daiimus/gelatinous/issues
```

**Authentication:**
- Personal Access Token (PAT) stored in `secret_settings.py`
- Required scope: `public_repo` (for issue creation in public repositories)
  - Note: If repository were private, would need full `repo` scope
- Token format: `GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_your_token_here"`

**Request Headers:**
```python
{
    "Authorization": f"token {GITHUB_TOKEN}",
    "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json",
    "User-Agent": "Gelatinous-MUD-Bug-Reporter"
}
```

**Request Payload:**
```python
{
    "title": f"[BUG] {player_description}",
    "body": formatted_issue_body,
    "labels": ["bug", "player-reported", category]
}
```

### Dependencies
- `requests` library (HTTP client for GitHub API)
- `json` (standard library, payload formatting)
- `datetime` (standard library, timestamps)
- `git` command line (to get current commit hash)

---

## Rate Limiting

### Per-Player Limits
- **Daily Limit:** 30 bug reports per account per day (resets at midnight UTC)
- **Cooldown:** None (no delay between reports)
- **Storage:** Track in `account.db.bug_reports_today` with date stamp

### Rate Limit Messages
```python
# When limit reached
"You've reached the daily limit of 30 bug reports. Please try again tomorrow."

# When limit approaching
"Bug report submitted! (You have {remaining} reports remaining today.)"
```

### Reset Logic
```python
def check_rate_limit(account):
    today = datetime.now(UTC).date()
    last_date = account.db.bug_report_date
    
    if last_date != today:
        # New day, reset counter
        account.db.bug_report_count = 0
        account.db.bug_report_date = today
    
    count = account.db.bug_report_count or 0
    return count < 30
```

Title: Grenades don't explode when rigged to exits
Category: Combat
Created: 2025-10-22
Updated: 2025-10-22
URL: https://github.com/daiimus/gelatinous/issues/44

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:

**Reported By:** PlayerName
**Location:** Room #123

**Category:** Combat

**Description:**

I tried to rig a grenade to the north exit.
I expected it to explode when someone walked through.
Instead, nothing happens and the grenade vanishes.

Steps:
1. Get grenade from inventory
2. Type "rig grenade to north"
3. Command succeeds but grenade disappears
4. Someone walks through exit - no explosion

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments (2):

1. daiimus (2025-10-22)
Thanks for the report! I can reproduce this. The issue is in the exit trigger 
system not properly handling deferred explosions. Working on a fix.

2. daiimus (2025-10-23)
Fixed in commit abc123f. The trap system now properly defers explosion logic
until the trigger fires. Will be in next deployment.

## Technical Implementation

### EvMenu Integration
The command uses Evennia's EvMenu system for the interactive workflow:
- `node_title`: Prompts for bug title (text input node)
- `_validate_title_input`: Goto callable that validates title
- `node_category`: Category selection menu (numbered options)
- `node_open_editor`: Opens EvEditor for detailed description

**Key Settings:**
- `cmd_on_exit=None` - Prevents default "look" command when menu exits
- Uses goto callables instead of node functions for validation steps
- EvEditor opens with 0.1s delay after menu closes to avoid input capture

### EvEditor Integration
Multi-line editor for bug descriptions:
- `loadfunc`: Returns empty string (blank buffer)
- `savefunc`: Creates GitHub issue if description valid (min 10 chars)
- `quitfunc`: Shows cancellation message only if save wasn't called
- Uses flag `caller.ndb._bug_editor_saved` to track save state

### Dependencies
- `evennia.commands.default.muxcommand.MuxCommand` - For switch support
- `evennia.utils.evmenu.EvMenu` - Interactive menu system
- `evennia.utils.eveditor.EvEditor` - Multi-line text editor
- `requests` library (HTTP client for GitHub API)
- `json` (standard library, payload formatting)
- `datetime` (standard library, timestamps)
- `git` command line (to get current commit hash)

### Network Failures
```python
try:
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload, timeout=10)
    response.raise_for_status()
except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
    caller.msg("|rBug report timed out. Please try again.|n")
except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
    caller.msg("|rUnable to connect to GitHub. Please try again later.|n")
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
    if e.response.status_code == 401:
        caller.msg("|rGitHub authentication failed. Please contact staff.|n")
    elif e.response.status_code == 403:
        caller.msg("|rRate limited by GitHub. Please try again later.|n")
    else:
        caller.msg(f"|rGitHub API error: {e.response.status_code}|n")
```

### Input Validation
```python
def sanitize_bug_description(text):
    """Sanitize user input to prevent markdown injection or excessive content."""
    # Limit length
    if len(text) > 5000:
        return text[:5000] + "\n\n[Description truncated at 5000 characters]"
    
    # Escape potential markdown injection (but allow basic formatting)
    # Keep newlines, basic formatting, but escape potentially malicious patterns
    
    return text.strip()
```

### Missing Configuration
```python
if not hasattr(settings, 'GITHUB_TOKEN') or not settings.GITHUB_TOKEN:
    caller.msg("|rBug reporting is not configured. Please contact staff.|n")
    return
```

## Security Considerations

### Token Security
- ✅ Store token in `secret_settings.py` (gitignored)
- ✅ Never log or display token in error messages
- ✅ Use environment variable as fallback: `os.getenv('GITHUB_TOKEN')`
- ✅ Restrict token scope to minimum required (`repo` only)

### Input Sanitization
- ✅ Limit description length (5000 characters)
- ✅ Strip potentially malicious markdown patterns
- ✅ Validate category against whitelist
- ✅ Escape special characters appropriately

### Rate Limiting
- ✅ 30 reports per account per day
- ✅ Prevent spam/abuse
- ✅ No cooldown between reports (trust players)

### Data Privacy
- ✅ No email addresses exposed
- ✅ No G.R.I.M. stats leaked
- ✅ Only #dbref for location (not descriptive room name)
- ✅ Account username only (not internal IDs)

---
