# G.R.I.M. Grappling System Specification

## Overview

The G.R.I.M. Grappling System is a comprehensive close-combat mechanism that emphasizes **restraint over violence** while providing tactical depth for complex combat scenarios. It integrates seamlessly with the proximity system, movement mechanics, and yielding philosophy to create dynamic, roleplay-focused grappling encounters.

## Design Philosophy

### 1. **Restraint-First Approach**
- **Default Intent**: Grappling begins as restraint, not violence
- **Escalation Control**: Violence requires explicit choice by participants
- **De-escalation Opportunities**: Multiple chances to avoid harm
- **Roleplay Priority**: Combat serves narrative, not mechanics

### 2. **Tactical Complexity**
- **Movement Integration**: Grappling affects and is affected by positioning
- **Multi-Character Dynamics**: Complex interactions between multiple grapplers
- **State Management**: Rich state system supporting various scenarios
- **Strategic Depth**: Advanced options for experienced players

### 3. **Mechanical Consistency**
- **Attribute-Based**: Uses core G.R.I.M. attributes (primarily Motorics)
- **Contest System**: Opposed rolls determine outcomes
- **State Validation**: Robust error checking and cleanup
- **Integration**: Seamless connection to combat, movement, and social systems

## Core Mechanics

### Grapple States

#### **Grappling Relationship States**
1. **Not Grappling**: Character has no grapple involvement
2. **Grappling Someone**: Character is holding/restraining another
3. **Being Grappled**: Character is held/restrained by another
4. **Mutual Grapple**: Two characters grappling each other (rare, contest-based)

#### **Grapple Intent States**
1. **Restraint Mode** (Default): Non-violent holding/control
2. **Violent Mode**: Active struggle with damage potential

#### **Participation States**
1. **Yielding**: Accepting restraint, no resistance
2. **Non-Yielding**: Active resistance, automatic escape attempts

### Primary Attributes
- **Motorics**: Primary attribute for grapple initiation, contests, and escape attempts
- **Grit**: Used for drag resistance during room traversal (physical endurance/willpower)
- **Resonance**: Tertiary for reading intent and de-escalation (future implementation)

---

## Grapple Initiation

### Command: `grapple <target>`

#### **Prerequisites**
- Must be in same room as target
- Target must be valid character
- Cannot grapple self
- Cannot grapple if already grappling someone
- Cannot grapple if being grappled by someone else

#### **Proximity Requirements**
- **Combat Initiation**: Grapple can initiate combat and establish proximity
- **Existing Combat**: Must be in melee proximity with target
- **Rush Mechanics**: Can "rush in" when initiating new combat

#### **Contest Resolution**
```
Grappler Roll: 1d[Motorics]
Defender Roll: 1d[Motorics]

Success: Grappler > Defender
Failure: Defender >= Grappler
```

*Note: All grapple initiation, takeover, and escape attempts use Motorics vs Motorics*

#### **Success Outcomes**
1. **Grapple Established**: Two-way relationship created
   - Grappler: `grappling_dbref` → Target
   - Target: `grappled_by_dbref` → Grappler
2. **State Changes**:
   - Grappler: Auto-yields (restraint intent)
   - Target: Remains non-yielding (auto-resistance)
3. **Proximity**: Both characters enter/maintain proximity
4. **Targeting**: Target auto-targets grappler for potential retaliation

#### **Failure Outcomes**
1. **No Relationship**: No grapple state changes
2. **Yielding Consequences**: 
   - If grappler initiated combat: Auto-yield
   - If defender joined combat this round AND has no existing combat target: Also auto-yield
   - If defender was already engaged in combat: Continue existing fight
3. **Messaging**: Failure messages with narrative context

---

## Grapple Contests (Takeover)

### Multi-Grapple Scenarios

#### **Scenario 1: Contest for Existing Victim**
- **Setup**: A grapples B, then C attempts to grapple B
- **Mechanism**: Contest between A and C for control of B
- **Resolution**: Winner gets B, loser gets nothing
- **Outcome**: B remains grappled by winner

#### **Scenario 2: Grappling an Active Grappler** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Setup**: A grapples B, then C attempts to grapple A
- **Implementation**: System now detects "grapple_takeover" scenario
- **Behavior**: Force A to release B, then C can grapple A
- **Sequence**: 
  1. C initiates grapple on A (detected as grapple_takeover)
  2. Contest: C's Motorics vs A's Motorics
  3. If successful: A releases B automatically, C grapples A
  4. If failed: A maintains grapple on B, C becomes yielding (if initiated combat)

### Contest Mechanics
```
Challenger Roll: 1d[Motorics]
Current Grappler Roll: 1d[Motorics]

Success: Challenger > Current Grappler → Takeover
Failure: Current Grappler >= Challenger → Maintains control
```

## Grapple Maintenance

### Automatic Resistance System

#### **Non-Yielding Victims**
- **Auto-Escape**: Attempt escape every combat round
- **Contest**: Victim Motorics vs Grappler Motorics
- **Success**: Break free, switch to violent mode, target grappler
- **Failure**: Remain grappled, continue struggling

#### **Yielding Victims**
- **No Auto-Escape**: Accept restraint peacefully
- **Manual Escape**: Can use `escape` command to switch to violent mode
- **Roleplay Focus**: Emphasis on negotiation and de-escalation

### Grapple Damage System

#### **Restraint Mode** (Default)
- **No Damage**: Pure control/positioning
- **Messaging**: Restraint-focused descriptions
- **Intent**: Subdue without harm

#### **Violent Mode** (Escalation)
- **Damage Potential**: Both parties can take/deal damage
- **Escalation Triggers**:
  - Victim uses `escape` command
  - Automatic escape success
  - External violence (attacks on grappling pair)
- **Damage Types**:
  - Grapple damage hits: Control damage during struggle
  - Grapple damage misses: Failed attempts to harm

### Human Shield System

#### **Bodyshield Mechanics** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
When a character attacks someone who is grappling a victim, the victim may intercept the attack as an involuntary human shield.

#### **Shield Chance Calculation**
```
Base Shield Chance: 40%
+ Grappler Motorics modifier: +5% per point above 1
+ Victim Resistance modifier: 
  - Yielding victim: +10% (easier to position)
  - Non-yielding victim: -10% (struggling against positioning)
- Ranged Attack modifier: -20% (harder to shield against projectiles)
```

#### **Shield Resolution Process**
1. **Attack Targeting**: Someone attacks a grappler
2. **Shield Check**: Roll d100 vs calculated shield chance
3. **Shield Success**: 
   - **Shield Messages**: Inform all parties about interception
   - **Target Redirect**: Change attack target to grappled victim
   - **Normal Combat Flow**: Proceed with standard attack resolution on victim
4. **Shield Failure**: Attack proceeds normally against intended grappler target

#### **Shield Messaging System**
- **Attacker Message**: `"Your attack is intercepted by {victim} as {grappler} uses them as a shield!"`
- **Grappler Message**: `"You position {victim} to absorb {attacker}'s attack!"`
- **Victim Message**: `"You are forced into the path of {attacker}'s attack by {grappler}!"`
- **Observer Message**: `"{grappler} uses {victim} as a human shield against {attacker}'s attack!"`

#### **Integration with Combat System** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Pre-Attack Check**: Shield check occurs before normal attack resolution
- **Target Substitution**: Victim becomes new target for existing combat flow
- **Damage Application**: Uses normal `take_damage()` on victim
- **Combat Messages**: Uses existing weapon-based combat message system
- **Natural Escalation**: Existing "external violence" triggers handle mode changes automatically

#### **Strategic Implications**
- **Defensive Grappling**: Makes grappling a protective strategy
- **Victim Motivation**: Strong incentive for victims to escape or negotiate
- **Multi-Character Tactics**: Affects targeting decisions in group combat
- **Roleplay Opportunities**: Creates dramatic tension and moral dilemmas

#### **Grenade Bodyshield System** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
When grenades explode in proximity to grappling pairs, the grappled victim can absorb damage intended for their grappler.

#### **Current Grenade Shielding**
- **Holder Shielding**: When grenade explodes in someone's hands, others in proximity take 50% damage due to "body shielding"
- **Proximity-Based**: All characters in proximity list take equal damage (except holder reduction)
- **Grappling Integration**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Grenade explosions now check for grappling-based human shields

#### **Grenade Human Shield Mechanics** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
When a grenade explodes, before applying damage to characters in proximity:

1. **Grappling Check**: ✅ For each character in the explosion proximity list who is grappling someone
2. **Shield Calculation**: ✅ Simplified implementation - if grappler and victim both in blast radius, automatic shield
3. **Shield Success**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
   - **Damage Redirect**: Grappler takes no explosion damage
   - **Victim Absorption**: Grappled victim takes double explosion damage (grappler's + their own)
   - **Shield Messages**: ✅ Explosive-specific messaging for dramatic effect
4. **Shield Failure**: Both grappler and victim take normal explosion damage (N/A - automatic shield in simplified implementation)

#### **Explosive Shield Messaging System** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Grappler Message**: ✅ `"You instinctively use {victim} to shield yourself from the {grenade} blast!"`
- **Victim Message**: ✅ `"You are forcibly positioned to absorb the {grenade} explosion meant for {grappler}!"`
- **Observer Message**: ✅ `"{grappler} uses {victim} as a blast shield against the {grenade} explosion!"`

#### **Implementation Status** ✅ **COMPLETE**
The grenade explosion system (`CmdThrow.py`) has been updated to include grappling shield checks in all explosion scenarios:
- ✅ `explode_grenade()` - Normal grenade explosions during CmdThrow
- ✅ `explode_standalone_grenade()` - Chain reaction and timer-based explosions  
- ✅ `explode_rigged_grenade()` - Exit-triggered trap explosions
- ✅ `trigger_auto_defuse_explosion()` - Failed auto-defuse explosions
- ✅ `trigger_early_explosion()` - Failed manual defuse explosions

**Simplified Implementation**: When both grappler and victim are in blast radius, the grappler automatically uses the victim as a shield (no chance calculation needed), the grappler takes no damage, and the victim takes double damage.

## Movement Integration

### Current Implementation ✅

#### **Exit Traversal (Drag System)**
- **Conditions for Dragging**:
  - Grappler is yielding (restraint mode)
  - Grappler not targeted by others (except victim)
  - Victim fails resistance roll (Victim Grit vs Grappler Grit)
- **Successful Drag**:
  - Both characters move to new room
  - Combat state transfers to new handler
  - Grapple relationship preserved
- **Failed Resistance**:
  - Grapple broken automatically
  - Movement blocked

#### **Combat Movement Restrictions**
- **Being Grappled**: Blocks flee, retreat, advance, charge
- **Grappling Someone**: Charge auto-releases grapple if targeting others

### Needed Implementations ⚠️

#### **Advance While Grappling** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Current Implementation**: Full logic for grappler advancing while maintaining hold
- **Behavior**: 
  - Allow advance to new target while holding victim
  - Drag victim along during advance if conditions met
  - Victim inherits grappler's new proximity relationships
- **Restrictions**: Only if victim is yielding for room traversal

#### **Retreat While Grappling** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Current Implementation**: Complete grapple-specific retreat logic
- **Behavior**:
  - Allow retreat while maintaining grapple
  - Drag victim back with grappler
  - Both maintain proximity after retreat
- **Consistency**: Both remain in proximity post-retreat

#### **Proximity Inheritance** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Principle**: Victim inherits all of grappler's proximity relationships
- **Timing**: After successful movement (advance/retreat/charge)
- **Mechanism**: Copy grappler's proximity set to victim
- **Rationale**: Victim is "dragged along" and gains same positioning

---

## Special Actions

### Escape Grapple: `escape`

#### **Mechanics**
- **State Change**: Victim switches from yielding to non-yielding
- **Immediate Effect**: Violent mode engaged
- **Contest**: Handled on next combat round
- **Targeting**: Auto-target grappler for retaliation

#### **Outcomes**
- **Success**: Break free, remain in proximity, target grappler
- **Failure**: Remain grappled but now in violent mode

### Release Grapple: `release`

#### **Mechanics**
- **Voluntary Action**: Grappler chooses to let go
- **No Contest**: Automatic success
- **State Preservation**: Yielding states maintained
- **Proximity**: Both remain in proximity

#### **Strategic Use**
- **De-escalation**: Peaceful resolution option
- **Tactical**: Free up for other actions
- **Roleplay**: Character development opportunities

---

## State Management

### Database Fields

#### **Combat Entry Fields**
```python
{
    "char": Character object,
    "grappling_dbref": int or None,      # Who this character is grappling
    "grappled_by_dbref": int or None,    # Who is grappling this character
    "is_yielding": bool,                 # Yielding state
    "target_dbref": int or None,         # Combat target
    # ... other combat fields
}
```

#### **Validation Rules**
1. **Mutual Exclusivity**: Can't grapple multiple people
2. **Relationship Consistency**: Cross-references must match
3. **Combat Participation**: All grapple participants must be in combat
4. **Proximity Requirement**: Grappling requires proximity

### State Cleanup System

#### **Automatic Validation** (`validate_and_cleanup_grapple_state`)
- **Stale References**: Remove references to non-existent characters
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure bidirectional consistency
- **Combat State Sync**: Align with combat handler state
- **Self-Grapple Prevention**: Block impossible relationships

#### **Cleanup Triggers**
- Every combat round (proactive)
- Character removal from combat
- Handler shutdown
- Error conditions
