# Long Description System Specification

## Implementation Status: COMPLETED ✅

**Implementation Complete**: All core components implemented and tested.  
**Testing Status**: Fully functional in Evennia server - in-game validation completed.  
**Documentation Status**: Specification updated to reflect current implementation state.

## Overview

The Long Description (longdesc) system provides players with the ability to set detailed descriptions for specific body parts/locations on their characters. These descriptions appear when other players look at their character, creating rich, personalized character appearances.

## Core Principles

1. **Player Agency**: Players control their character's appearance descriptions
2. **Staff Override**: Staff can set longdescs on any character for content moderation
3. **Layered Architecture**: System designed to integrate with future clothing, equipment, and injury systems
4. **Visibility Control**: Only visible body parts show descriptions
5. **Future-Proof**: Foundation for clothing coverage, injuries, cybernetics, tattoos

## Permission System

### Player Access
- **Self-modification only**: Players can only set longdescs on their own characters
- **Public visibility**: Longdescs visible to all players via look command
- **No consent system**: Players responsible for their own descriptions
- **Optional participation**: Players not required to set longdescs

### Staff Override
- **Permission-based access**: Staff with Builder+ permissions can target other characters
- **Same command interface**: Staff use standard commands with character targeting
- **Content moderation**: Staff can modify any character's longdescs
- **Hierarchical permissions**: Uses Evennia's perm() and perm_above() lock functions

## Body Location System

### Supported Locations
The system supports distinct body locations with left/right differentiation and extensibility for additional appendages:

#### Core Body Locations
- `head` - Overall head/skull area
- `face` - Facial features and expressions
- `left_eye` / `right_eye` - Individual eye descriptions for asymmetry
- `left_ear` / `right_ear` - Ear shape, piercings, modifications
- `neck` - Neck area, throat
- `chest` - Chest/torso front
- `back` - Back and shoulder blades
- `abdomen` - Stomach/belly area
- `groin` - Lower torso/hip area

#### Paired Appendages (Left/Right Support)
- `left_arm` / `right_arm` - Individual arm descriptions
- `left_hand` / `right_hand` - Hands, fingers, nails
- `left_thigh` / `right_thigh` - Upper leg descriptions
- `left_shin` / `right_shin` - Lower legs/calves
- `left_foot` / `right_foot` - Feet, toes, stance

#### Extensible Appendage System
The system is designed to support additional appendages beyond standard human anatomy:

- **Additional Arms**: `left_arm_2`, `right_arm_2`, `left_hand_2`, `right_hand_2`
- **Prehensile Tails**: `tail`, `tail_2` (for multiple tails)
- **Extra Legs**: `left_leg_3`, `right_leg_3`, `left_foot_3`, `right_foot_3`
- **Wings**: `left_wing`, `right_wing`
- **Tentacles**: `tentacle_1`, `tentacle_2`, etc.
- **Other**: Any anatomically relevant appendage following naming convention

### Location Constants
Body locations are defined as constants (similar to Mr. Hands system) to ensure:
- Consistent referencing across codebase
- Easy validation and error handling
- Support for non-standard anatomies
- Integration with future systems
- **Auto-creation of defaults** like Mr. Hands system
- **Centralized configuration** in constants file
- **High practical limits** with theoretical unlimited support
- **Anatomy source of truth** - foundation for all body-related systems

#### Constants Structure
Following the Mr. Hands pattern, body locations will be defined in `world/combat/constants.py`:

```python
# Default human anatomy (auto-created on character creation)
DEFAULT_LONGDESC_LOCATIONS = {
    "head": None, "face": None, "left_eye": None, "right_eye": None, 
    "left_ear": None, "right_ear": None, "neck": None,
    "chest": None, "back": None, "abdomen": None, "groin": None,
    "left_arm": None, "right_arm": None, "left_hand": None, "right_hand": None,
    "left_thigh": None, "right_thigh": None, "left_shin": None, "right_shin": None,
    "left_foot": None, "right_foot": None
}

# Practical limit for total body locations per character
MAX_LONGDESC_LOCATIONS = 50  # Very high, accommodates extensive modifications

# Individual description character limit
MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH = 1000  # Generous limit, allows detailed descriptions

# Paragraph formatting thresholds
PARAGRAPH_BREAK_THRESHOLD = 400  # Characters before automatic paragraph break
REGION_BREAK_PRIORITY = True     # Prefer breaking between anatomical regions

# Valid location validation set (expandable)
VALID_LONGDESC_LOCATIONS = set(DEFAULT_LONGDESC_LOCATIONS.keys())
```

#### Anatomy Validation System
- **Character anatomy source of truth** - longdesc system serves as foundation for all body-related systems
- **Dynamic validation** - only locations present in character's anatomy dictionary are settable
- **Extensible validation** - supports any anatomy configuration (alien, cybernetic, etc.)
- **Error prevention** - prevents setting descriptions for non-existent body parts

## Command Interface

### Primary Command: `@longdesc`

**Syntax**: `@longdesc <location> "<description>"`

**Examples**:
```
@longdesc face "weathered features with high cheekbones"
@longdesc left_eye "a piercing blue eye with flecks of gold"
@longdesc right_eye "a cybernetic replacement with a red LED"
@longdesc left_hand "calloused hand with dirt under the fingernails"
@longdesc right_hand "a prosthetic metal hand with intricate engravings"
@longdesc chest "broad shoulders tapering to a narrow waist"
@longdesc tail "a long, serpentine tail ending in a barbed tip"
@longdesc left_wing "a massive feathered wing, midnight black"
```

### Command Behavior
- **Validation**: Location must be valid body location constant
- **Storage**: Description stored in character database
- **Replacement**: New description overwrites existing for that location
- **Removal**: Empty description removes longdesc for location
- **Feedback**: Confirmation of successful setting/removal
- **Self-targeting**: Players can only modify their own longdescs by default
- **Staff override**: Staff with Builder+ permissions can target other characters

### Command Variations
- `@longdesc <location>` - View current description for location
- `@longdesc/list` - List all available body locations for this character
- `@longdesc` - List all set longdescs for character (only shows non-None values)
- `@longdesc/clear <location>` - Remove description for location (set to None)

#### Staff Commands (Permission Override)
- `@longdesc <character> <location> "<description>"` - Set longdesc on another character
- `@longdesc/clear <character> <location>` - Clear specific location on another character

## Implementation Details

### Character Search System
Staff targeting uses a comprehensive search system that:
1. **Global search**: Attempts to find character globally first
2. **Local search**: Falls back to searching locally if global fails
3. **Location search**: Searches within caller's current location
4. **Manual search**: Iterates through location contents for exact name matches
5. **List handling**: Properly handles search results returned as lists vs single objects
6. **Type validation**: Confirms target is actually a Character typeclass before proceeding

### Permission Integration
- Uses Evennia's lock system: `caller.locks.check_lockstring()`
- Permission check: `perm(Builder) or perm_above(Builder)`
- Hierarchical permissions: Developers, Admins automatically included via `perm_above()`
- Graceful fallback: Non-staff users get standard self-targeting behavior

## Integration with Look System

### Character Appearance Display (REDESIGNED ✅)
When a player executes `look <character>`, the system displays a clean, sectioned format:

1. **Character Name + Base Description**: Name and main description on consecutive lines (no blank line between)
2. **Longdesc + Clothing Integration**: Detailed body part descriptions with clothing
3. **Wielded Items Display**: Natural language listing of held items via hands system
4. **Staff Administrative Info**: Comprehensive inventory for Builder+ permissions

#### New Clean Format Example:
```
CharacterName
Base character description appears here immediately after the name with no blank line between.

First paragraph of longdesc and clothing descriptions, automatically formatted based on anatomical regions and character thresholds for natural reading flow.

Second paragraph continues with additional body descriptions and worn items, maintaining smart paragraph breaks between anatomical regions when appropriate.

CharacterName is holding a weapon and an item.

With your administrative visibility, you see: item1 [#123], item2 [#456], weapon [#789], clothing [#012]
```

#### Template Variable System Enhancement ✅
- **Case Sensitivity Support**: Both {They}/{their} and {they}/{their} work properly
- **Third-Person Consistency**: All descriptions use consistent third-person perspective regardless of viewer
- **Pronoun Processing**: Based on character's `sex[biology]` attribute with he/him/his, she/her/hers, they/them/their support
- **Grammar Correction**: Eliminates awkward constructions like "You carries himself"

#### Wielded Items Integration ✅
- **Hands System Integration**: Uses `hands[equipment]` attribute to determine wielded items
- **Natural Language Display**: "drek is holding a light pistol" with proper grammar
- **Multiple Items Support**: "holding a knife, a pistol, and a grenade" with correct articles
- **Empty Hands Display**: "drek is holding nothing" for transparency
- **Combat Readiness**: Immediate visibility of character's weapon state

#### Administrative Features ✅
- **Enhanced Staff Visibility**: "With your administrative visibility, you see:" instead of generic "You see:"
- **Comprehensive Inventory**: Shows all character contents with dbrefs for debugging
- **Permission-Based**: Only visible to Builder+ permissions via `check_permstring("Builder")`
- **Redundancy Acceptable**: Wielded items appear in both sections for complete admin information

#### Smart Paragraph Formatting ✅
- **Automatic line breaks**: System adds paragraph breaks when combined longdescs exceed character threshold
- **Readable flow**: Prevents wall-of-text appearance for verbose descriptions  
- **Threshold-based**: Configurable character count triggers paragraph separation (400 characters)
- **Anatomical grouping**: Line breaks respect anatomical regions when possible
- **Region-aware breaking**: 70% threshold for natural anatomical transitions
- **Clothing integration**: Clothing descriptions participate in paragraph formatting system

#### Display Order (Anatomical Head-to-Toe) ✅
1. **Head region**: head, face, left_eye, right_eye, left_ear, right_ear, neck
2. **Torso region**: chest, back, abdomen, groin  
3. **Arm region**: left_arm, right_arm, left_hand, right_hand
4. **Leg region**: left_thigh, right_thigh, left_shin, right_shin, left_foot, right_foot
5. **Extended appendages**: tail, wings, tentacles (in order of creation/numbering)

**Current Implementation**: Uses `_format_longdescs_with_paragraphs()` method with smart breaking logic and anatomical region awareness for natural paragraph flow.

#### Paragraph Break Logic ✅  
- **Character counting**: System tracks cumulative character count as it builds description
- **Smart breaking**: When threshold reached, insert paragraph break before next anatomical region
- **Region respect**: Avoid breaking within anatomical regions when possible
- **Overflow handling**: If single region exceeds threshold, break at most logical location within region
- **Coverage integration**: Only visible descriptions (body longdescs + clothing longdescs) count toward thresholds
- **Writer freedom**: No forced connecting words or narrative structure - writers control their own style
- **Constants-driven**: Uses `PARAGRAPH_BREAK_THRESHOLD`, `REGION_BREAK_PRIORITY`, and `ANATOMICAL_REGIONS` for fine-tuning

### Visibility Rules ✅
- **Default**: All body locations are visible unless covered by clothing
- **Clothing Coverage**: Worn items hide covered locations and display their own descriptions instead
- **Unset Locations**: Body parts without longdesc descriptions remain invisible
- **Template Processing**: All visible descriptions processed for third-person perspective consistency

## Data Storage

### Character Database Structure
Following the Mr. Hands AttributeProperty pattern:

```python
# Auto-created on character creation (like Mr. Hands)
character.db.longdesc = {
    "head": None, "face": "weathered features with high cheekbones", 
    "left_eye": "a piercing blue eye with flecks of gold", "right_eye": "a cybernetic replacement with a red LED",
    "left_ear": None, "right_ear": None, "neck": None,
    "chest": "broad shoulders tapering to a narrow waist", 
    "back": None, "abdomen": None, "groin": None,
    "left_arm": None, "right_arm": None,
    "left_hand": "calloused hand with dirt under the fingernails",
    "right_hand": "a prosthetic metal hand with intricate engravings",
    "left_thigh": None, "right_thigh": None,
    "left_shin": None, "right_shin": None,
    "left_foot": None, "right_foot": None,
    # Extended anatomy (when added)
    "tail": "a long, serpentine tail ending in a barbed tip",
    "left_wing": "a massive feathered wing, midnight black"
}
```

#### Implementation Pattern
```python
# In Character typeclass (following Mr. Hands pattern)
longdesc = AttributeProperty(
    DEFAULT_LONGDESC_LOCATIONS.copy(),
    category="appearance", 
    autocreate=True
)
```

### Storage Principles
- **AttributeProperty Pattern**: Following Mr. Hands system architecture
- **Auto-Creation**: All default locations created with None values on character creation
- **Dictionary Format**: Easy lookup and modification
- **None as Unset**: Only locations with string values are "set" (None = invisible)
- **Persistent Storage**: AttributeProperty handles automatic database persistence
- **Unicode Support**: Full character set support for descriptions

## Layered System Architecture

### Current Layer: Base Longdescs
- Player-set descriptions stored in database
- Direct display when location is visible
- Manual setting via @longdesc command

### Future Layer Integration Points

#### Clothing/Equipment Coverage ✅ **COMPLETED**
- Items define coverage areas: `coverage = ["chest", "arms"]`
- **Coverage uses same location constants** as longdesc system for consistency
- **Covered longdescs hidden** - base body descriptions not shown when covered
- **Clothing longdescs displayed** - clothing items have their own appearance descriptions
- **Coverage longdescs count toward paragraph thresholds** - clothing descriptions participate in formatting
- **Dynamic styling system** - items support multiple wear states (rolled up, zipped, etc.)
- **Full integration implemented** - clothing system working with longdesc visibility rules

#### Custom Fitting System (Future)
- **Tailor fitting command** for custom clothing adjusted to unique anatomies
- **Adaptive coverage** - clothing automatically maps to available body locations
- **Custom measurements** - items fitted to specific character's appendage configuration
- **Coverage validation** - ensures clothing coverage matches character's anatomy

#### Injury/Medical System
- Injuries override or supplement base descriptions
- Temporary modifications (bandages, casts)
- Permanent modifications (scars, prosthetics)
- Medical condition visibility

#### Cybernetic/Modification System
- Cybernetic implants as location overrides
- Tattoo system integration
- Body modification descriptions
- Enhancement visibility rules

#### Equipment Integration
- Worn equipment affects appearance
- Weapon/tool integration
- Armor and protection display
- Magical item effects

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Validation System
- **Location validation against character's actual anatomy** (anatomy source of truth)
- **Description length limits (1000 characters max per location)**
- **Paragraph formatting validation (400 character break threshold)**
- Content filtering capabilities
- Input sanitization
- **Anatomical order preservation** for display consistency
- **Dynamic anatomy checking** - only allow longdescs for locations character actually possesses

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient dictionary lookups
- **Minimal database queries** (AttributeProperty handles persistence)
- **No caching needed** (Evennia's scale makes real-time assembly efficient)
- Lazy loading of complex descriptions
- **Direct database access** for optimal performance

### Error Handling
- Invalid location handling
- Database storage failures
- Malformed input protection
- Graceful degradation

## Privacy and Content

### Privacy Model
