# Sticky Grenade System Specification

## Overview
Magnetic grenades that adhere to armor/clothing based on metal content and magnetic properties. Grenades stick to specific body locations on specific armor pieces, creating tactical gameplay around armor removal and positioning.

### Grenade Representation Architecture

**Q: How do we represent the grenade once it's stuck?**

**A: The grenade is magnetically stuck to the armor item itself, moving with the armor wherever it goes:**

1. **Physical Location**: `grenade.location = armor_object` (magnetically bonded to the armor)
2. **State Tracking**: `grenade.db.stuck_to_armor = armor_object` (which armor it's stuck to)
3. **Bidirectional Reference**: `armor.db.stuck_grenade = grenade` (armor knows it has a grenade)
4. **Explosion Location**: Uses `grenade.location.location` to find room (armor's location)

**Why This Makes Sense:**
- ✅ **Physical realism**: Magnetic bond is to the metal armor, not the person
- ✅ **Armor removal doesn't break bond**: Grenade stays stuck to armor when removed
- ✅ **Dropped armor = dropped grenade**: Grenade moves with armor automatically
- ✅ **Proximity danger**: Dropped armor with grenade stays in proximity (existing explosion logic)
- ✅ **Multi-step escape**: Must remove, drop, AND flee to be safe
- ✅ **Tactical depth**: Can't just remove and be safe - must get distance

**Object Hierarchy:**
```
grenade.location = armor (stuck to the armor item)
armor.location = character (worn) OR room (on ground)

When worn:  grenade → armor → character → room
When dropped: grenade → armor → room
```

**Alternative Rejected:**
- ❌ `grenade.location = character` - Implies grenade stuck to person, breaks on armor removal
- ❌ `grenade.location = room` - Doesn't move with armor automatically

---

## Quick Reference: Implementation Checklist

### Core Changes Required:
1. ✅ Add `metal_level` and `magnetic_level` to Item class
2. ✅ Create StickyGrenade typeclass with `is_sticky` and `magnetic_strength`
3. ✅ Add stick check in CmdThrow after hit determination
4. ✅ Modify explosion code to check for armor hierarchy
5. ✅ Add warning messages to armor remove command
6. ✅ Implement helper functions in utils

### Key Functions to Implement:
- `calculate_stick_chance(metal, magnetic, strength)` → Returns 0-100
- `get_explosion_room(grenade)` → Returns (room, carrier)
- `establish_stick(grenade, armor, character, location)` → Sets up bond
- `get_outermost_armor_at_location(character, location)` → Finds armor
- `get_stuck_grenades_on_character(character)` → Lists grenades

### Critical Code Locations:
- **CmdThrow.py line ~850**: Add stick check after hit determination
- **CmdThrow.py line ~2000**: Modify explosion to check armor hierarchy
- **CmdWear.py/remove**: Add stuck grenade warning messages
- **items.py**: Add metal_level/magnetic_level attributes
- **items.py return_appearance()**: Show stuck grenades

### Testing Priority:
1. Stick to steel armor (should succeed)
2. Bounce off cloth/aluminum (should fail)
3. Remove armor → grenade stays stuck
4. Remove armor → flee → explosion occurs in old room
5. Pick up armor with grenade → explosion in hands

## 1. Armor/Clothing Material Properties

### New Attributes

Every armor/clothing item will have two new attributes:

```python
armor.db.metal_level (integer 0-10)
# Represents the amount of metal in the item
# 0 = No metal whatsoever
# 1-3 = Minimal metal (buckles, rivets, small fasteners)
# 4-6 = Moderate metal (metal plates, reinforcements, chainmail sections)
# 7-9 = Heavy metal (predominantly metal construction)
# 10 = Pure metal (entirely metal construction)

armor.db.magnetic_level (integer 0-10)  
# Represents how magnetically responsive the metal is
# 0 = Non-magnetic (no ferrous metals - aluminum, titanium, synthetic, cloth, leather)
# 1-3 = Weakly magnetic (stainless steel, treated/alloyed metals with low iron content)
# 4-6 = Moderately magnetic (mild steel, some carbon steel)
# 7-9 = Highly magnetic (carbon steel, most ferrous alloys)
# 10 = Pure ferrous metal (raw iron, unalloyed steel)
```

### Material Examples

**Non-Magnetic Materials:**
- Cloth/Leather: metal=0, magnetic=0
- Synthetic fabrics: metal=0, magnetic=0
- Aluminum plate: metal=8, magnetic=0
- Titanium plate: metal=9, magnetic=0
- Ceramic plate: metal=9, magnetic=0
- Brass: metal=7, magnetic=0

**Weakly Magnetic:**
- Stainless steel (304): metal=9, magnetic=2
- Stainless steel (430): metal=9, magnetic=3
- Bronze with steel fasteners: metal=4, magnetic=2

**Moderately Magnetic:**
- Mild steel plate: metal=9, magnetic=5
- Mixed steel/aluminum: metal=7, magnetic=4
- Treated carbon steel: metal=8, magnetic=6

**Highly Magnetic:**
- Carbon steel plate: metal=9, magnetic=8
- Iron plate: metal=10, magnetic=10
- Ferrous alloy armor: metal=9, magnetic=7

**Important Notes:**
- Titanium is NOT magnetic (magnetic=0) despite being metal
- Aluminum is NOT magnetic (magnetic=0) despite being metal
- Ceramic plates are NOT magnetic (magnetic=0) despite being hard/protective
- Only ferrous metals (iron-containing) are magnetic
- Builder responsibility to assign appropriate values

## 2. Sticky Grenade Properties

### New Grenade Typeclass: StickyGrenade

Inherits from existing grenade/explosive system.

### Attributes

```python
grenade.db.is_sticky = True  # Boolean flag identifying sticky grenades
grenade.db.magnetic_strength = integer (1-10)  # Magnet power level

# Stuck state tracking
grenade.db.stuck_to_character = Character object or None
grenade.db.stuck_to_location = "body_location_string" or None  # e.g., "chest", "left_arm"
grenade.db.stuck_to_armor = Armor object or None  # The specific armor piece it's stuck to
```

### Magnetic Strength Levels

```
1-3: Weak magnet (requires high metal/magnetic levels to stick)
4-6: Moderate magnet (sticks to most ferrous metals)
7-9: Strong magnet (sticks reliably to any ferrous metal)
10: Extremely strong magnet (may stick even to weakly magnetic materials)
```

---

## 3. Stick Mechanics

### Stick Chance Calculation (Option C - Realistic)

```python
def calculate_stick_chance(metal_level, magnetic_level, grenade_strength):
    """
    Calculate probability that grenade will stick to armor.
    
    Requirements:
    - Magnetic level must be sufficient (ferrous metal present)
    - Metal level provides surface area for attachment
    - Both must meet minimum thresholds
    
    Returns: integer 0-100 (percentage chance)
    """
    
    # THRESHOLD CHECK: Is material magnetic enough?
    if magnetic_level < (grenade_strength - 3):
        return 0  # Not magnetic enough - no stick possible
    
    # THRESHOLD CHECK: Is there enough metal surface area?
    if metal_level < (grenade_strength - 5):
        return 10  # Very small chance - not enough metal surface
    
    # CALCULATION: Both thresholds met
    base_chance = 40
    metal_bonus = metal_level * 5  # 0 to 50 bonus
    magnetic_bonus = magnetic_level * 5  # 0 to 50 bonus
    
    total_chance = base_chance + metal_bonus + magnetic_bonus
    
    # Cap at 95% (always 5% chance of failure for gameplay)
    return min(total_chance, 95)
```

### Example Calculations

**Example 1: Steel Plate Armor**
- metal_level = 9, magnetic_level = 8, grenade_strength = 5
- Thresholds: magnetic (8 >= 2) ✓, metal (9 >= 0) ✓
- Calculation: 40 + (9*5) + (8*5) = 40 + 45 + 40 = 125 → capped at 95%
- Result: 95% stick chance

**Example 2: Cloth Armor**
- metal_level = 0, magnetic_level = 0, grenade_strength = 5
- Thresholds: magnetic (0 >= 2) ✗
- Result: 0% stick chance

**Example 3: Aluminum Plate**
- metal_level = 8, magnetic_level = 0, grenade_strength = 5
- Thresholds: magnetic (0 >= 2) ✗
- Result: 0% stick chance (not magnetic)

**Example 4: Weak Magnet on Iron**
- metal_level = 10, magnetic_level = 10, grenade_strength = 2
- Thresholds: magnetic (10 >= -1) ✓, metal (10 >= -3) ✓
- Calculation: 40 + (10*5) + (10*5) = 40 + 50 + 50 = 140 → capped at 95%
- Result: 95% stick chance

**Example 5: Strong Magnet on Stainless Steel**
- metal_level = 9, magnetic_level = 2, grenade_strength = 8
- Thresholds: magnetic (2 >= 5) ✗
- Result: 0% stick chance (not magnetic enough for strong magnet requirements)

**Example 6: Moderate Setup**
- metal_level = 6, magnetic_level = 5, grenade_strength = 5
- Thresholds: magnetic (5 >= 2) ✓, metal (6 >= 0) ✓
- Calculation: 40 + (6*5) + (5*5) = 40 + 30 + 25 = 95%
- Result: 95% stick chance

---

## 4. Thrown Sticky Grenade Behavior

### Throw Resolution Flow

```
1. Normal throw mechanics (existing system)
   - Throw command executed
   - Hit location determined by throw system
   - Target hit/miss determined

2. IF grenade.db.is_sticky == True:
   
   a. Get hit location from throw result
   
   b. Find armor/clothing covering that location:
      covering_items = get_items_covering_location(target, hit_location)
      
   c. FOR EACH covering item (outermost layer first):
      - Check if item already has a stuck grenade
      - If yes, skip this item (one grenade per item)
      - If no, attempt stick check
      
   d. Calculate stick chance:
      metal_level = item.db.metal_level
      magnetic_level = item.db.magnetic_level
      grenade_strength = grenade.db.magnetic_strength
      stick_chance = calculate_stick_chance(metal, magnetic, strength)
      
   e. Roll for stick:
      roll = random(1, 100)
      
      IF roll <= stick_chance:
         ### STICK SUCCESS ###
         grenade.db.stuck_to_character = target
         grenade.db.stuck_to_location = hit_location
         grenade.db.stuck_to_armor = item
         
         # Move grenade to special stuck state
         # NOT in target's inventory
         # NOT on ground
         # Tracked via stuck_to_* attributes
         
         # Continue countdown normally
         # Send stick success messages
         
      ELSE:
         ### STICK FAILURE ###
         # Grenade bounces off
         # Falls to room floor (existing behavior)
         # Send stick failure messages
```

### Multi-Layer Armor Handling

When multiple armor pieces cover the same location, check layers from outermost to innermost:

```python
# Example: Character has jacket (layer 3) and shirt (layer 2) both covering chest
# Grenade hits chest

layers_on_chest = [
    (jacket, layer=3, metal=2, magnetic=1),
    (shirt, layer=2, metal=0, magnetic=0)
]

# Check outermost first
for item in sorted(layers_on_chest, key=lambda x: x.layer, reverse=True):
    if item.already_has_grenade:
        continue  # Skip, try next layer
    
    stick_chance = calculate_stick_chance(item.metal, item.magnetic, grenade.strength)
    if roll_stick(stick_chance):
        stick_to(item)
        break
    # If miss, try next layer inward
```

---

## 5. Rigged Sticky Grenade Behavior

### Rig Trigger Flow

```
1. Character triggers rigged grenade (existing rig system)

2. IF grenade.db.is_sticky == True:
   
   a. Determine random hit location (they're walking through):
      hit_location = select_random_hit_location()
      # Or use existing rig hit location logic
   
   b. Same stick resolution as thrown grenade:
      - Find armor covering location
      - Check for existing stuck grenades
      - Calculate stick chance
      - Roll for stick
      
   c. IF stick succeeds:
      ### RIGGED STICK SUCCESS ###
      - Grenade sticks to character
      - Character carries ticking grenade with them
      - Message: "The grenade SPRINGS out and CLAMPS onto your [location]!"
      
   d. IF stick fails:
      ### RIGGED STICK FAILURE ###
      - Falls to floor (existing behavior)
      - Normal ground explosion
      - Message: "The grenade bounces off and clatters to the floor!"
```

---

## 6. Stuck Grenade State Management

### State Properties & Object Representation

**IMPLEMENTED DESIGN:** Grenade is physically located inside the armor object.

```python
# When grenade sticks to armor:
grenade.location = armor_object            # Physical location (CRITICAL)
grenade.db.stuck_to_armor = armor_object   # State tracking reference
grenade.db.stuck_to_location = "chest"     # Body location string
armor.db.stuck_grenade = grenade           # Bidirectional reference

# IMPORTANT: stuck_to_character is OPTIONAL/DEPRECATED
# The primary relationship is: grenade → armor
# Character relationship is derived via: grenade.location.location
# You can optionally set it for quick lookups, but it's not required:
grenade.db.stuck_to_character = character  # Optional convenience reference
```

**Stick Initialization (On Stick Success):**
```python
def establish_stick(grenade, armor, character, hit_location):
    """
    Establish magnetic bond between grenade and armor.
    Called after successful stick roll.
    """
    # Set physical location
    grenade.location = armor
    
    # Set state tracking
    grenade.db.stuck_to_armor = armor
    grenade.db.stuck_to_location = hit_location
    
    # Optional convenience reference
    # (Can be derived from armor.location, so not strictly necessary)
    grenade.db.stuck_to_character = character
    
    # Bidirectional reference
    armor.db.stuck_grenade = grenade
    
    # Grenade is now in armor.contents
    # When armor moves, grenade automatically moves with it
```

**Why This Design Works:**
- ✅ Grenade physically in armor (armor.contents)
- ✅ Moves automatically when armor moves
- ✅ Room found via `grenade.location.location` hierarchy
- ✅ Integrates with existing explosion code (see Section 6.5)
- ✅ Armor can be queried for stuck grenades
- ✅ Character relationship derived from armor.location

### Visual Representation

**In Character Inventory:**
```
> inventory
You are carrying:
  a frag grenade (STUCK TO YOUR CHEST - 3 seconds!)
  a jacket (has stuck grenade!)
  a knife
```

**In Armor Display:**
```
> armor comprehensive
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║              Armor Comprehensive Display              ║
╠════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║                                                        ║
║ Location      Equipment           Rating               ║
║ ──────────────────────────────────────────────────    ║
║ Torso         jacket (III)         [!!! GRENADE !!!]  ║
║ Left Arm      sleeve (II)                              ║
║ Right Arm     sleeve (II)                              ║
║                                                        ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**In Room:**
```
> look
A dark alley
This is a narrow alleyway between two buildings.
Obvious exits: north, south
You see:
  John is here (wearing jacket with LIVE GRENADE stuck to it!)
  a jacket (with LIVE GRENADE magnetically clamped - 2 seconds!)
```

**Armor Object Appearance:**
When looking at armor with stuck grenade, enhance description:

```python
# In typeclasses/items.py or armor typeclass:
def return_appearance(self, looker):
    """Enhanced appearance showing stuck grenades."""
    desc = super().return_appearance(looker)
    
    # Check for stuck grenade
    if hasattr(self.db, 'stuck_grenade') and self.db.stuck_grenade:
        grenade = self.db.stuck_grenade
        remaining = getattr(grenade.ndb, 'countdown_remaining', 0)
        if remaining > 0:
            desc += f"\n|r!!! A {grenade.key} is MAGNETICALLY CLAMPED to it ({remaining}s remaining) !!!|n"
        else:
            desc += f"\n|rA {grenade.key} is magnetically clamped to it.|n"
    
    return desc
```

### Movement Behavior

When character with stuck grenade moves:

```python
# In character movement hook (at_after_move or similar):
def at_after_move(self, source_location, **kwargs):
    # Grenade automatically moves because grenade.location = self
    # No special code needed for movement tracking!
    
    # Check for stuck grenades to display warning messages
    stuck_grenades = get_stuck_grenades(self)
    
    for grenade in stuck_grenades:
        # Grenade already in new room (moved with character)
        # Send visual warnings to new room
        self.location.msg_contents(
            f"|r{self.key} enters with a {grenade.key} STUCK TO THEIR {grenade.db.stuck_to_location}!|n",
            exclude=self
        )
```

### Countdown Behavior

Stuck grenades use existing countdown system with enhanced messages. The countdown **continues uninterrupted** even when grenade becomes unstuck:

```python
# Countdown ticker logic (enhanced with stuck detection):
def tick():
    remaining = getattr(grenade.ndb, NDB_COUNTDOWN_REMAINING, 0)
    
    # Check if grenade is stuck
    if grenade.db.stuck_to_character:
        # Enhanced messages for stuck grenades
        character = grenade.db.stuck_to_character
        location_name = grenade.db.stuck_to_location.upper()
        
        character.msg(f"|rThe {grenade.key} STUCK TO YOUR {location_name} beeps menacingly: {remaining} seconds!|n")
        
        if character.location:
            character.location.msg_contents(
                f"|rThe {grenade.key} stuck to {character.key}'s {location_name} beeps menacingly: {remaining} seconds!|n",
                exclude=character
            )
    else:
        # Normal countdown messages (existing)
        # Used for: ground grenades, unstuck grenades, grenades in hands
        if grenade.location:
            # If in character inventory (unstuck)
            from typeclasses.characters import Character
            if isinstance(grenade.location, Character):
                grenade.location.msg(f"|rThe {grenade.key} in your hands beeps: {remaining} seconds!|n")
                if grenade.location.location:
                    grenade.location.location.msg_contents(
                        f"|r{grenade.location.key}'s {grenade.key} beeps: {remaining} seconds!|n",
                        exclude=grenade.location
                    )
            else:
                # On ground
                grenade.location.msg_contents(f"|yThe {grenade.key} on the ground beeps: {remaining} seconds!|n")

# CRITICAL: Ticker persists through state changes
# - Grenade stuck at 8 seconds
# - Armor removed at 3 seconds
# - Grenade STILL explodes at 0 seconds
# - No timer reset, no interruption
```

**Example Timeline (Successful Escape):**
```
T=8s: Grenade sticks to worn jacket
      "The frag grenade CLAMPS onto your jacket!" 
T=7s: "The grenade stuck to your jacket beeps: 7 seconds!"
T=6s: "The grenade stuck to your jacket beeps: 6 seconds!"
T=5s: Player removes jacket (grenade STILL stuck to jacket!)
      "You frantically RIP OFF your jacket and hurl it to the ground!"
      "The grenade remains MAGNETICALLY CLAMPED to it!"
T=4s: "The frag grenade on the discarded jacket beeps: 4 seconds!"
      (Character STILL IN PROXIMITY - still in danger!)
T=3s: "The frag grenade on the discarded jacket beeps: 3 seconds!"
T=2s: Player flees north
      "You flee north!"
T=1s: "The frag grenade on the jacket beeps: 1 seconds!" (in old room)
T=0s: BOOM! (Grenade explodes in old room, player is safe)
```

**Example Timeline (Stayed Too Long - Death):**
```
T=8s: Grenade sticks to worn jacket
T=7s: "The grenade stuck to your jacket beeps: 7 seconds!"
T=6s: Player removes jacket
      "You frantically RIP OFF your jacket!"
T=5s: "The frag grenade on the discarded jacket beeps: 5 seconds!"
      (Player looking through inventory, distracted...)
T=4s: "The frag grenade on the discarded jacket beeps: 4 seconds!"
T=3s: "The frag grenade on the discarded jacket beeps: 3 seconds!"
T=2s: "The frag grenade on the discarded jacket beeps: 2 seconds!"
      (Player still in same room...)
T=1s: "The frag grenade on the discarded jacket beeps: 1 seconds!"
T=0s: BOOM! Player takes FULL grenade damage (in proximity to explosion)
      Player dies. Jacket destroyed.
```

**Example Timeline (Picked Up Jacket - Very Bad):**
```
T=8s: Grenade sticks to worn jacket
T=7s: Player removes jacket
T=6s: Player picks up jacket (grenade still stuck!)
      "You pick up the jacket - the grenade is STILL STUCK to it!"
T=5s: "The frag grenade stuck to the jacket in your hands beeps: 5 seconds!"
T=4s: Player tries to drop jacket
      "You drop the jacket!"
T=3s: Player flees north
T=2s: Player is safe in new room
T=1s: Grenade explodes in old room
      Player survives!
```

### Explosion Behavior

Stuck grenade explosions use existing proximity explosion logic with location hierarchy:

```python
def explode_stuck_grenade(grenade):
    """Handle stuck grenade explosion using existing logic."""
    
    # Grenade is stuck to armor: grenade.location = armor
    armor = grenade.location
    
    if not armor or not hasattr(armor, 'location'):
        # Shouldn't happen, but fallback to normal explosion
        explode_standalone_grenade(grenade)
        return
    
    # Find where the explosion occurs
    # If armor is worn: armor.location = character, room = character.location
    # If armor is on ground: armor.location = room
    
    from typeclasses.characters import Character
    if isinstance(armor.location, Character):
        # Armor is worn or in someone's inventory
        carrier = armor.location
        room = carrier.location
        
        # CRITICAL: Character carrying/wearing armor with stuck grenade
        # Treats as "explosion in inventory/hands"
        # Character takes DOUBLE damage
        blast_damage = getattr(grenade.db, DB_BLAST_DAMAGE, 10)
        carrier_damage = blast_damage * 2
        damage_type = getattr(grenade.db, 'damage_type', 'blast')
        
        carrier.take_damage(carrier_damage, location="chest", injury_type=damage_type)
        carrier.msg(f"|rThe {grenade.key} stuck to your {armor.key} EXPLODES!|n You take {carrier_damage} damage!")
        
        if room:
            room.msg_contents(
                f"|r{carrier.key}'s {grenade.key} EXPLODES!|n",
                exclude=carrier
            )
            
            # Nearby characters take reduced damage (body shields it)
            proximity_list = get_unified_explosion_proximity(grenade)
            for character in proximity_list:
                if character != carrier and hasattr(character, 'msg'):
                    reduced_damage = blast_damage // 2
                    character.take_damage(reduced_damage, location="chest", injury_type=damage_type)
                    character.msg(f"The explosion hits you!")
    
    else:
        # Armor is on ground
        room = armor.location
        
        # NORMAL GROUND EXPLOSION
        # Uses existing explosion proximity logic
        # Everyone in proximity takes FULL damage
        blast_damage = getattr(grenade.db, DB_BLAST_DAMAGE, 10)
        damage_type = getattr(grenade.db, 'damage_type', 'blast')

**Explosion Scenarios:**

1. **Grenade stuck to worn armor:**
   - Double damage to wearer (explosion in inventory)
   - Half damage to nearby characters (body shields)
   
2. **Grenade stuck to armor on ground:**
   - Full damage to all in proximity (normal ground explosion)
   - Uses existing proximity system
   
3. **Grenade stuck to armor in someone's inventory (carried, not worn):**
   - Double damage to carrier (explosion in hands)
   - Half damage to nearby characters (body shields)

## 7. Armor Removal Integration

### Key Feature: Remove Armor (Grenade Stays Stuck)

**CRITICAL DESIGN:** Grenade is magnetically bonded to the armor, NOT the person. Removing armor does NOT break the magnetic bond.

```python
# When character attempts to remove armor piece:
> remove jacket

# Check if armor has stuck grenade:
IF jacket.db.stuck_grenade:
    grenade = jacket.db.stuck_grenade
    
    # Allow removal (this is a FEATURE)
    # BUT grenade stays magnetically bonded to armor!
    
    # Physical location changes:
    jacket.location = character.location      # Armor to room floor
    # grenade.location = jacket               # NO CHANGE - still stuck to armor!
    
    # Stuck state: NO CHANGE
    # grenade.db.stuck_to_armor = jacket      # Still stuck!
    # jacket.db.stuck_grenade = grenade       # Still has grenade!
    
    # Messages:
    character.msg("You frantically |yRIP OFF|n your jacket and hurl it to the ground! The grenade is |RSTILL STUCK TO IT|n, ticking away!")
    character.location.msg_contents(
        f"{character.key} frantically |yRIPS OFF|n their jacket! The grenade remains |RMAGNETICALLY CLAMPED|n to it, still ticking!",
        exclude=character
    )
    
    # CRITICAL: Character is STILL IN DANGER!
    # - Jacket on ground at character's location
    # - Grenade still stuck to jacket (in jacket.contents)
    # - Character STILL IN PROXIMITY to grenade
    # - Grenade will damage character unless they FLEE!
    # - Character's body location now exposed
    # - Must take additional action to be safe (flee, pick up and throw, etc.)
```

### Multi-Step Escape Requirement

**To survive a stuck grenade, character must:**

```python
# Step 1: Remove armor (grenade still dangerous!)
> remove jacket
"You RIP OFF your jacket! The grenade is still ticking!"
# State: jacket on ground, grenade stuck to jacket, character in proximity

# Step 2: FLEE to another room (get out of blast radius!)
> north
"You flee north!"
# State: Character safe in new room, grenade explodes in old room

# OR

# Step 2: Pick up jacket and throw it away
> get jacket
"You pick up the jacket with the stuck grenade!"
> throw jacket at window
"You hurl the jacket with the stuck grenade through the window!"
# State: Jacket+grenade in different room, character safe

# OR

# Step 2: Wait and hope (BAD IDEA)
> (do nothing)
# BOOM! Grenade explodes, character takes damage (in proximity)
```

### What Happens If You Pick Up Armor With Stuck Grenade?

```python
# Scenario: Armor on ground with stuck grenade
> look
You see:
  a jacket (with LIVE GRENADE stuck to it! 2 seconds!)

> get jacket
# ALLOW but WARN
"You pick up the jacket - the grenade is |RSTILL MAGNETICALLY CLAMPED|n to it, |RTICKING|n!"

# State change:
# jacket.location = character (in inventory)
# grenade.location = jacket (still stuck to armor)
# grenade.db.stuck_to_armor = jacket (still stuck)

# If grenade explodes while in inventory:
# Explosion occurs "in hands" (double damage to character)
# Because grenade.location.location = character
```

### No Special "Remove Grenade" Command Needed

The existing `remove` command for armor/clothing handles grenade removal automatically. This creates interesting tactical gameplay:

**Scenario 1: Light Armor**
- Sticky grenade on cloth jacket
- Quick to remove
- Minor loss of protection
- Grenade safely discarded

**Scenario 2: Heavy Armor**
- Sticky grenade on plate carrier
- Removing plate carrier exposes vital torso
- Significant loss of protection
- Difficult tactical choice

**Scenario 3: Multiple Layers**
- Sticky grenade on outer jacket
- Must remove jacket (easy)
- Inner layers still provide protection
- Good situation

**Scenario 4: Inner Layer**
- Sticky grenade on undershirt (somehow stuck through outer layer gap)
- Must remove outer layers first
- Then remove undershirt
- Time-consuming
- Dangerous situation

## 8. Targeting Priority System

### Multi-Target Scenarios

When multiple potential targets are available, grenades should prefer:

1. **Targets without sticky grenades** (favor clean targets)
2. **Armor locations without sticky grenades** (one per item)
3. **Higher metal/magnetic properties** (more likely to stick)

```python
def select_best_stick_target(potential_targets, grenade):
    """
    From multiple potential targets, select best one for sticking.
    Used in area effect grenades or multi-target scenarios.
    """
    
    scored_targets = []
    
    for target in potential_targets:
        score = 0
        
        # Check if target already has ANY stuck grenades
        has_stuck_grenade = check_for_stuck_grenades(target)
        if not has_stuck_grenade:
            score += 100  # STRONG preference for clean targets
        
        # Check armor quality
        best_armor = find_best_armor_for_sticking(target, grenade)
        if best_armor:
            metal_score = best_armor.db.metal_level * 5
            magnetic_score = best_armor.db.magnetic_level * 5
            score += metal_score + magnetic_score
        
        scored_targets.append((target, score, best_armor))
    
    # Return highest scoring target
    return max(scored_targets, key=lambda x: x[1])
```

### Per-Item Limitation

```python
# Only ONE grenade can stick to each armor/clothing item
# This prevents unrealistic "covered in grenades" situations

armor_item.db.stuck_grenade = grenade_object or None

# When checking if grenade can stick:
if armor_item.db.stuck_grenade is not None:
    # Skip this armor piece
    # Try next layer inward
    # Or try different target entirely
```

---

## 9. Message System

### Message Categories

**Stick Success (Thrown):**
```python
{
    'attacker_msg': "Your {grenade} |rCLAMPS|n onto {target}'s {location} with a magnetic |rTHUNK|n!",
    'victim_msg': "The {grenade} |rCLAMPS|n onto your {location} with a magnetic |rTHUNK|n!",
    'observer_msg': "The {grenade} |rCLAMPS|n onto {target}'s {location} with a magnetic |rTHUNK|n!"
}
```

**Stick Success (Rigged):**
```python
{
    'victim_msg': "As you pass through, a {grenade} |rSPRINGS|n out and |rCLAMPS|n onto your {location}!",
    'observer_msg': "A {grenade} |rSPRINGS|n out and |rCLAMPS|n onto {victim}'s {location}!"
}
```

**Stick Failure (Bounces Off):**
```python
{
    'attacker_msg': "Your {grenade} |ybounces off|n {target}'s {location} and clatters to the ground.",
    'victim_msg': "The {grenade} |ybounces off|n your {location} and clatters to the ground.",
    'observer_msg': "The {grenade} |ybounces off|n {target}'s {location} and clatters to the ground."
}
```

**Stuck Countdown (Each Tick):**
```python
{
    'victim_msg': "The {grenade} |rSTUCK TO YOUR {location}|n beeps |Rmenacingly|n: |Y{countdown}|n seconds!",
    'observer_msg': "The {grenade} |rstuck to {victim}'s {location}|n beeps |Rmenacingly|n: |Y{countdown}|n seconds!"
}
```

**Stuck Explosion:**
```python
{
    'victim_msg': "The {grenade} |rSTUCK TO YOUR {location}|n |RDETONATES|n with |Rdevastating force|n!",
    'observer_msg': "The {grenade} |rstuck to {victim}'s {location}|n |RDETONATES|n with |Rdevastating force|n!"
}
```

**Armor Removal with Stuck Grenade:**
```python
{
    'character': "You frantically |yRIP OFF|n your {armor} and hurl it away! The stuck {grenade} beeps |Rmenacingly|n from the discarded armor.",
    'observer': "{character} frantically |yRIPS OFF|n their {armor} and hurls it away! A stuck {grenade} beeps |Rmenacingly|n from the discarded armor."
}
```

## 10. Integration Points & Files

### Files Requiring Modification

**typeclasses/items.py**
- Add metal_level attribute to base Item class (default 0)
- Add magnetic_level attribute to base Item class (default 0)
- These will be inherited by all armor/clothing
- Add return_appearance() enhancement to show stuck grenades

```python
# In Item class:
class Item(DefaultObject):
    metal_level = AttributeProperty(0, autocreate=True)
    magnetic_level = AttributeProperty(0, autocreate=True)
    
    def return_appearance(self, looker):
        """Enhanced to show stuck grenades."""
        # ... existing code ...
        # Add stuck grenade check
```

**typeclasses/explosives.py (new file or add to items.py)**
- Create StickyGrenade class
- Inherits from existing Grenade/Explosive class
- Add is_sticky and magnetic_strength attributes
- Implement stuck state tracking attributes

```python
class StickyGrenade(Grenade):
    is_sticky = AttributeProperty(True, autocreate=True)
    magnetic_strength = AttributeProperty(5, autocreate=True)
    stuck_to_armor = AttributeProperty(None, autocreate=True)
    stuck_to_location = AttributeProperty(None, autocreate=True)
```

**commands/CmdThrow.py**
- **Location:** After hit location determination in throw resolution
- **Hook:** Around line 800-900 in throw_object() method
- Add stick check for sticky grenades
- Integrate stick success/failure handling
- Add stick-specific messages
- Set grenade.location = armor on stick success

```python
# After hit determination:
if obj.db.is_sticky:
    # Get armor covering hit location
    armor = get_outermost_armor_at_location(target, hit_location)
    if armor and not armor.db.stuck_grenade:
        stick_chance = calculate_stick_chance(
            armor.db.metal_level,
            armor.db.magnetic_level,
            obj.db.magnetic_strength
        )
        if random.randint(1, 100) <= stick_chance:
            establish_stick(obj, armor, target, hit_location)
            # Send stick success messages
        else:
            # Send stick failure messages (bounce off)
```

**commands/CmdThrow.py - Explosion Code**
- **Location:** In explode_standalone_grenade() function (around line 1990-2100)
- **Hook:** Add armor hierarchy check before Character check
- Modify holder detection to handle armor hierarchy

```python
# In explode_standalone_grenade():
holder = None
if grenade.location:
    from typeclasses.characters import Character
    from typeclasses.items import Item
    
    # NEW: Check if grenade is in armor
    if isinstance(grenade.location, Item):
        armor = grenade.location
        if armor.location and isinstance(armor.location, Character):
            holder = armor.location
    # EXISTING: Check if grenade directly in character
    elif isinstance(grenade.location, Character):
        holder = grenade.location
```

**commands/CmdRig.py (or check_rigged_grenade function in CmdThrow.py)**
- **Location:** In rigged grenade trigger logic (around line 1700-1850)
- After rig trigger, add stick check for sticky grenades
- Same stick resolution as thrown grenades
- Add rigged stick messages

**commands/CmdWear.py or clothing system**
- **Location:** In remove_clothing() or similar method
- When removing armor, check for stuck grenades
- Display warning messages about stuck grenade
- Grenade stays in armor (no state change needed - just move armor)

```python
# In remove command:
if armor.db.stuck_grenade:
    caller.msg("You frantically |yRIP OFF|n your {armor}! The grenade is |RSTILL STUCK TO IT|n!")
    # Let armor move to ground normally
    # Grenade automatically moves with it (grenade.location = armor)
```

**world/combat/utils.py (or new explosives_utils.py)**
- Add calculate_stick_chance() function
- Add get_stuck_grenades_on_character() helper
- Add get_explosion_room() helper (for hierarchy traversal)
- Add establish_stick() helper
- Add find_best_stick_target() for multi-target (future)

```python
def calculate_stick_chance(metal_level, magnetic_level, grenade_strength):
    """Calculate stick probability. Returns 0-100."""
    # See Section 3 for full implementation
    
def get_explosion_room(grenade):
    """Get room and carrier from grenade location hierarchy."""
    # See Section 6.4 for full implementation
    
def establish_stick(grenade, armor, character, hit_location):
    """Establish magnetic bond between grenade and armor."""
    # See Section 6.1 for full implementation
```

**typeclasses/characters.py**
- **Optional:** Add movement hook to display warning messages
- **Location:** In at_after_move() method
- Grenades automatically move (in armor, armor in character)
- Only need to add warning messages

```python
def at_after_move(self, source_location, **kwargs):

## 11. Edge Cases & Special Situations

### Edge Case: Picking Up Armor With Stuck Grenade

**Critical:** Grenade stays magnetically bonded to armor even when picked up.

```python
# Armor on ground with stuck grenade
> look
A dark alley
You see:
  a jacket (with LIVE GRENADE magnetically clamped to it! 2 seconds!)

> get jacket
"You pick up the jacket - the grenade is STILL STUCK to it, TICKING!"

# Result:
# - jacket.location = character (in inventory)
# - grenade.location = jacket (still stuck to armor)
# - jacket.db.stuck_grenade = grenade (still bonded)
# - grenade.db.stuck_to_armor = jacket (still bonded)

# Character is now carrying a ticking time bomb!
# When it explodes: "explosion in hands" logic (double damage)
```

**Edge Case: Wearing Armor With Stuck Grenade**

```python
# Can you wear armor that has a stuck grenade?
> wear jacket

# Option A: Prevent wearing
"You can't wear that - there's a |RTICKING GRENADE|n magnetically clamped to it!"

# Option B: Allow wearing (dramatic!)
"You desperately pull on the jacket - the stuck grenade presses against your chest!"
# jacket.location = character (worn)
# grenade.location = jacket (still stuck)
# Grenade explodes on character's body (double damage + specific location)
```

**Edge Case: Dropping Worn Armor With Stuck Grenade**

```python
# Normally can't drop worn items
> drop jacket
"You must remove it first."

# But if possible via command:
> drop jacket (wearing it, has stuck grenade)

# RECOMMENDED: Treat as implicit remove
# Same as "remove jacket" behavior
jacket.location = character.location  # To ground
grenade.location = jacket              # Still stuck to jacket
# Character still in proximity, must flee
```

**Edge Case: Grenade Stuck to Armor in Someone's Inventory**

```python
# Armor being carried (not worn), gets grenade stuck to it
character.contents = [jacket, knife]
# Grenade thrown at character, hits jacket
# jacket.location = character (in inventory)

# Grenade sticks to jacket:
grenade.location = jacket
jacket.db.stuck_grenade = grenade

# Result:
# Character carrying ticking time bomb
# Explosion occurs "in inventory" (character's location)
# Full damage to character
```

### Edge Case: Character Dies with Stuck Grenade

```python
# Character death handling (existing system handles this via damage)
# No special code needed - grenade just explodes wherever character is
# Corpse takes damage (existing corpse system)
# Nearby characters take damage (existing proximity system)
```

### Edge Case: Grenade Timer Expires While Unstuck

```python
# If character removes armor before grenade explodes:
# Grenade on ground (normal state)
# Explosion occurs normally (existing system)
# No special handling needed
```

### Edge Case: Multiple Grenades Same Character

```python
# Allow multiple grenades on DIFFERENT body locations
# Example: One on chest, one on left_arm, one on right_leg
# Each grenade tracked independently
# Each armor piece can have ONE grenade max

stuck_grenades = [
    (grenade1, "chest", jacket),
    (grenade2, "left_arm", sleeve),
    (grenade3, "right_leg", pants)
]

# Limit: One grenade per armor item
# No limit on grenades per character (limited by body locations)
```

### Edge Case: Layered Armor Same Location

```python
# Grenade hits chest with multiple layers:
# - Plate carrier (outer, metal=9, magnetic=8)
# - Shirt (inner, metal=0, magnetic=0)

# Check outer layer first
if plate_carrier.no_grenade_yet and stick_check(plate_carrier):
    stick_to(plate_carrier)
    # Done
elif shirt.no_grenade_yet and stick_check(shirt):
    stick_to(shirt)  # Unlikely with metal=0
    # Done
else:
    # Bounce off completely
    fall_to_ground()
```

## 12. Gameplay Balance

### Tactical Considerations

**Advantages of Sticky Grenades:**
- Guaranteed to track target if stuck
- Cannot be easily discarded
- Forces difficult choices (protection vs. safety)
- Psychological warfare potential
- Effective against heavily armored targets

**Disadvantages of Sticky Grenades:**
- May not stick at all (bounce off)
- Completely ineffective against non-magnetic armor
- Telegraphed threat (visible countdown)
- Can be removed via armor removal
- Requires magnetic properties to function

**Counterplay Options:**
- Wear non-magnetic armor (aluminum, titanium, ceramic plates)
- Wear minimal metal armor (cloth, leather, synthetic)
- Practice quick armor removal
- Use layered armor (sacrifice outer layer)
- Maintain distance from throwers
- Use cover effectively
- Grapple grenade-carrier (human shield)

### Armor Meta-Game

This system creates interesting armor choices:

**Heavy Metal Armor:**
- Pros: High protection, intimidating
- Cons: Vulnerable to sticky grenades

**Light Non-Magnetic Armor:**
- Pros: Immune to sticky grenades, mobile
- Cons: Less protection overall

**Mixed Armor:**
- Pros: Balance of protection and magnetic resistance
- Cons: Compromise solution

**Layered Armor:**
- Pros: Can sacrifice outer layer to remove grenade
- Cons: Bulky, expensive

## 15. Builder Documentation

### For Game Builders: Setting Armor Properties

When creating armor/clothing items, consider these guidelines:

**Cloth/Fabric Items:**
```python
metal_level = 0
magnetic_level = 0
# Examples: shirts, pants, cloth armor, robes
```

**Leather Items:**
```python
metal_level = 1-2  # Buckles, studs
magnetic_level = 0-1  # Usually non-magnetic
# Examples: leather jackets, leather armor, belts
```

**Synthetic/Modern Materials:**
```python
metal_level = 0-2  # Minimal fasteners
magnetic_level = 0  # Non-magnetic
# Examples: kevlar vests, synthetic jackets, nylon gear
```

**Aluminum/Titanium Armor:**
```python
metal_level = 8-9  # Mostly metal
magnetic_level = 0  # NOT MAGNETIC
# Examples: aluminum plates, titanium armor, aircraft-grade materials
```

**Stainless Steel:**
```python
metal_level = 9
magnetic_level = 2-3  # Weakly magnetic
# Examples: decorative armor, stainless plate, modern tactical gear
```

**Carbon Steel Armor:**
```python
metal_level = 9
magnetic_level = 7-8  # Highly magnetic
# Examples: tactical steel plates, ballistic armor, combat gear
```

**Iron/Medieval Armor:**
```python
metal_level = 10
magnetic_level = 10  # Maximum magnetic
# Examples: iron plates, medieval armor, pure ferrous construction
```

**Ceramic Plates:**
```python
metal_level = 8-9  # Hard/protective but not metal
magnetic_level = 0  # NOT MAGNETIC
# Examples: ceramic trauma plates, composite armor
```

### Builder Commands (Future)

```
@set armor/metal_level = 5
@set armor/magnetic_level = 3
@create/drop sticky grenade:typeclasses.explosives.StickyGrenade
@set grenade/magnetic_strength = 7
```

## Summary: Key Architectural Decisions

### Grenade Bonding Mechanics

**CRITICAL DECISION:** Grenade is magnetically bonded to the armor item, NOT to the character.

```python
# Correct hierarchy:
grenade.location = armor           # Grenade physically in armor
armor.location = character OR room # Armor can be worn or on ground
```

**Why This Design:**
1. **Physical Realism:** Magnetic bond is to metal in armor, not to flesh
2. **Persistent Bond:** Removing armor doesn't break magnetic attraction
3. **Proximity Danger:** Dropped armor with grenade still threatens nearby characters
4. **Tactical Depth:** Must remove, drop, AND flee to be safe (3 steps, not 1)
5. **Existing Systems:** Integrates with existing explosion proximity logic

### Escape Sequence

To survive a sticky grenade:
1. **Remove armor** - Grenade stays stuck to armor, both on ground
2. **Still in danger** - Character in proximity to ground explosion
3. **Flee to safety** - Must leave room or get out of proximity

**Failed escapes:**
- Remove but don't flee → Takes full explosion damage
- Pick up dropped armor → Now carrying ticking bomb (double damage)
- Wear armor with stuck grenade → Suicide

### Integration Points

- **Existing explosion code** works with `grenade.location.location` hierarchy
- **Proximity system** already handles ground explosions
- **Inventory system** naturally handles armor as container
- **Message system** can detect stuck state via `grenade.db.stuck_to_armor`
