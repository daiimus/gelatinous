## System Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **Layered Protection**: Multiple armor pieces can stack for cumulative protection
2. **Realistic Weight**: All equipment has weight that affects movement and encumbrance
3. **Modular Design**: Plate carriers accept swappable armor plates for customization
4. **Intelligent Targeting**: Combat targeting considers both skill and tactical intelligence
5. **Strategic Depth**: Players make meaningful trade-offs between protection, mobility, and cost

### Integration with Existing Systems

- **Clothing System**: Uses existing coverage and layering mechanics
- **G.R.I.M. Combat**: Integrates with Grit, Resonance, Intellect, Motorics stats
- **Medical System**: Armor reduces damage before medical damage calculation
- **Command System**: New armor management commands alongside existing combat commands

---

## Armor Stacking Mechanics

### Stacking Rules

**Layer Processing Order**: Outermost â†’ Innermost (highest layer number first)

```python
# Example armor stack on chest:
Layer 3: Plate Carrier (armor_rating: 2) + Medium Ballistic Plate (armor_rating: 6) = 8 total
Layer 2: Tactical Jumpsuit (armor_rating: 1)
Layer 1: Undershirt (armor_rating: 0)
```

### Damage Reduction Calculation

Each armor layer processes damage sequentially:

1. **Get armor effectiveness** based on armor type vs damage type
2. **Calculate percentage reduction** from armor rating
3. **Apply remaining damage** to next layer
4. **Continue until** damage absorbed or all layers processed

### Armor Effectiveness Matrix

```python
ARMOR_EFFECTIVENESS = {
    # Format: armor_type: {damage_type: base_effectiveness}
    "kevlar": {
        "bullet": 0.80,    # Excellent vs bullets
        "stab": 0.20,      # Poor vs stabbing
        "cut": 0.15,       # Poor vs cutting
    },
    "ceramic": {
        "bullet": 0.90,    # Excellent vs bullets
        "blunt": 0.30,     # Poor vs blunt (shatters)
    },
    "steel": {
        "cut": 0.85,       # Excellent vs cutting
        "stab": 0.75,      # Good vs stabbing
        "bullet": 0.60,    # Moderate vs bullets
    },
    "leather": {
        "cut": 0.50,       # Moderate vs cutting
        "blunt": 0.40,     # Moderate vs blunt
        "bullet": 0.10,    # Poor vs bullets
    }
}
```

### Damage Reduction Formula

```python
# Per layer calculation
base_effectiveness = ARMOR_EFFECTIVENESS[armor_type][damage_type]
rating_multiplier = min(1.0, armor_rating / 10.0)
final_effectiveness = base_effectiveness * rating_multiplier
# Use round() instead of int() to avoid losing effectiveness on low damage
damage_reduction = round(remaining_damage * final_effectiveness)
remaining_damage = max(0, remaining_damage - damage_reduction)
```

## Weight and Encumbrance System

### Weight Categories

**Equipment Weight Classes**:
- **Light**: 0.1-1.0 kg (clothing, small items)
- **Medium**: 1.1-5.0 kg (armor pieces, weapons)
- **Heavy**: 5.1-15.0 kg (plate carriers, heavy armor)
- **Very Heavy**: 15.1+ kg (full tactical loadouts)

### Encumbrance Effects

**Total Weight Thresholds** (based on character strength):
- **Light Load** (0-20kg): No penalties
- **Medium Load** (21-40kg): -1 to movement-based rolls
- **Heavy Load** (41-60kg): -2 to movement-based rolls, slower combat
- **Overloaded** (61+kg): -3 to movement-based rolls, significant combat penalties

### Weight Calculation

```python
def get_total_weight(character):
    total = 0
    for location, items in character.worn_items.items():
        for item in items:
            base_weight = getattr(item, 'weight', 0)
            # Add weight of installed plates for carriers
            if hasattr(item, 'installed_plates'):
                for plate in item.installed_plates.values():
                    if plate:
                        total += getattr(plate, 'weight', 0)
            total += base_weight
    return total
```

## Modular Plate Carrier System

### Plate Carrier Mechanics

**Core Functionality**:
- Base carrier provides minimal protection (armor_rating: 1-2)
- Accepts armor plates in designated slots (front, back, left_side, right_side)
- **Slot-Specific Protection**: Each plate only protects the hit locations its slot covers
- Plates can be swapped in/out for different threat profiles

**Slot-to-Location Mapping**:
```python
plate_slot_coverage = {
    "front": ["chest"],        # Front plate protects chest
    "back": ["back"],          # Back plate protects back
    "left_side": ["torso"],    # Left side plate protects torso
    "right_side": ["torso"]    # Right side plate protects torso
}
```

**Protection Calculation**:
- When calculating armor for a hit location, only plates in slots covering that location contribute
- Example: A shot to "chest" only counts the front plate, not back or side plates
- This creates realistic protection profiles where sides can be vulnerable even with chest/back plates installed

### Plate Types and Specifications

```python
# Example plate specifications
BALLISTIC_PLATE_MEDIUM = {
    "name": "Medium Ballistic Plate",
    "armor_rating": 6,
    "armor_type": "ceramic",
    "weight": 2.5,  # kg
    "coverage": ["chest"],  # or ["back"] for back plate
    "threat_level": "IIIA",  # NIJ protection level
    "description": "Multi-curve ceramic plate rated for rifle threats"
}

SOFT_ARMOR_INSERT = {
    "name": "Soft Armor Insert", 
    "armor_rating": 3,
    "armor_type": "kevlar",
    "weight": 0.8,
    "coverage": ["chest", "back"],
    "threat_level": "II",
    "description": "Flexible Kevlar insert for pistol protection"
}
```

### Installation System

**Plate Installation Rules**:
- Plates must match carrier slot types
- Only one plate per slot
- Installation/removal takes time (prevents combat swapping)
- Damaged plates have reduced effectiveness

```python
# Plate carrier slots example
carrier.db.plate_slots = ["front", "back", "left_side", "right_side"]
carrier.db.installed_plates = {
    "front": None,      # Can accept chest plates
    "back": None,       # Can accept back plates  
    "left_side": None,  # Can accept side plates
    "right_side": None  # Can accept side plates
}
carrier.db.plate_slot_coverage = {
    "front": ["chest"],      # Front plate only protects chest
    "back": ["back"],        # Back plate only protects back
    "left_side": ["torso"],  # Left side only protects torso
    "right_side": ["torso"]  # Right side only protects torso
}
```

## Tactical Targeting System

### Targeting Philosophy

The system separates **ability to hit** from **target selection wisdom**:

- **Grit + Motorics**: Determines ability to execute precise vital strikes
- **Intellect**: Determines tactical wisdom in target selection relative to armor

### Vital Area Targeting Ability

**Skill Calculation**: `vital_targeting_skill = attacker_grit + attacker_motorics`

**Ability Tiers**:
- **Poor (2-4)**: 1.1x vital area bias - struggles with precision
- **Moderate (5-6)**: 1.3x vital area bias - decent precision
- **Good (7-8)**: 1.6x vital area bias - skilled precision
- **Excellent (9+)**: 2.0x vital area bias - expert precision

### Tactical Target Selection

**Intellect Levels**:
- **Low (1-2)**: No armor consideration - hits any vital area randomly
- **Moderate (3-4)**: Basic armor awareness
  - Unarmored vitals: +30% targeting preference
  - Heavily armored vitals: -20% targeting preference
- **High (5+)**: Advanced tactical analysis
  - Unarmored vitals: +50% targeting preference
  - Heavily armored vitals: -40% targeting preference

### Targeting Decision Matrix

**Example Scenario**: Target with armored chest/head, unarmored neck/abdomen

| Fighter Profile | Chest (Armored) | Head (Armored) | Neck (Unarmored) | Abdomen (Unarmored) |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Berserker (G7,M6,I2) | 2.0x | 2.0x | 2.0x | 2.0x |
| Tactician (G3,M4,I7) | 0.96x | 0.96x | 2.4x | 2.4x |  
| Elite (G6,M6,I6) | 1.2x | 1.2x | 3.0x | 3.0x |

### Implementation Logic

```python
def select_hit_location(character, success_margin=0, attacker=None):
    if attacker:
        # Calculate vital targeting ability
        grit = get_character_stat(attacker, "grit", 1)
        motorics = get_character_stat(attacker, "motorics", 1)
        intellect = get_character_stat(attacker, "intellect", 1)
        
        vital_skill = grit + motorics
        tactical_wisdom = intellect
        
        # Apply skill-based vital bias
        base_vital_bias = calculate_vital_bias(vital_skill)
        vital_bias = base_vital_bias * (1 + success_margin * 0.1)
        
        # Apply tactical target selection
        for location in vital_areas:
            armor_coverage = get_location_armor_coverage(character, location)
            
            if tactical_wisdom >= 5:
                if armor_coverage == 0:
                    location_weight *= vital_bias * 1.5  # Unarmored vital
                elif armor_coverage >= 4:
                    location_weight *= vital_bias * 0.6  # Heavily armored vital
            # ... additional tactical logic
```

## Integration Points

### Character Damage Processing

**Modified `take_damage()` method in `typeclasses/characters.py`**:
1. Calculate armor coverage for hit location
2. Process armor layers sequentially (outermost first)  
3. Apply damage reduction from each layer
4. Pass remaining damage to medical system

### Combat Handler Integration

**Modified hit location selection in `world/combat/handler.py`**:
1. Pass attacker to `select_hit_location()` 
2. Calculate targeting based on attacker's G.R.I.M. stats
3. Apply tactical target selection logic
4. Proceed with normal combat resolution

### Clothing System Integration

**Uses existing clothing mechanics**:
- Coverage areas determine armor protection zones
- Layer system determines armor processing order
- Worn items system manages equipped armor

---

## Balance Considerations

### Trade-off Matrix

| Loadout Type | Protection | Mobility | Cost | Tactical Flexibility |
|-------------|-----------|----------|------|---------------------|
| No Armor | None | Excellent | Free | Maximum |
| Light Armor | Low | Good | Low | High |
| Tactical Gear | Moderate | Fair | Moderate | Moderate |
| Heavy Armor | High | Poor | High | Low |
| Elite Setup | Very High | Poor | Very High | Low |

### Balancing Mechanisms

1. **Weight Penalties**: Heavy armor reduces mobility and combat effectiveness
2. **Cost Barriers**: Better armor requires significant resource investment
3. **Tactical Counters**: High-Intellect fighters can exploit armor gaps
4. **Maintenance**: Armor degrades and requires repair/replacement
5. **Situational**: Different armor works better in different scenarios

### Power Scaling Prevention

- **Diminishing Returns**: Additional armor layers provide less benefit
- **Specialization**: No single armor type excels against all damage
- **Resource Limits**: Weight and cost prevent "best of everything" builds
- **Tactical Counters**: Every defensive strategy has offensive counters

## Code Quality and Optimizations

### Performance Improvements

**Coverage Caching** (`typeclasses/characters.py`):
```python
# Cache coverage calculations to avoid repeated function calls
coverage_cache = {}
for item in armor_items:
    if item not in coverage_cache:
        coverage_cache[item] = item.get_current_coverage()
    current_coverage = coverage_cache[item]
```
- **Impact**: Significantly improves performance when processing multiple armor layers
- **Benefit**: Eliminates redundant `get_current_coverage()` calls in nested loops

### Safety Features

**Null Safety Checks** (`typeclasses/characters.py`):
```python
# Safety check: ensure item still exists (edge case: deleted mid-combat)
if not item or not hasattr(item, 'pk') or not item.pk:
    continue
```
- **Impact**: Prevents crashes if armor is deleted during combat
- **Benefit**: Graceful handling of edge cases

**Improved Exception Handling** (`world/medical/utils.py`):
```python
except Exception:
    # Catch only expected exceptions, let system errors propagate
    pass
```
- **Impact**: Avoids catching critical system errors like `KeyboardInterrupt`
- **Benefit**: Better error handling and debugging

### Mathematical Accuracy

**Rounding vs Truncation** (`typeclasses/characters.py`):
```python
# Use round() instead of int() to avoid losing effectiveness on low damage
layer_damage_reduction = round(remaining_damage * final_reduction_percent)
```
- **Before**: 2 damage Ã— 40% = 0.8 â†’ `int()` = 0 (armor does nothing!)
- **After**: 2 damage Ã— 40% = 0.8 â†’ `round()` = 1 (armor blocks 1 damage)
- **Impact**: Light armor now properly protects against small damage amounts

1. **Formation Combat**: Group tactics and armor coordination
2. **Penetration Mechanics**: Armor-piercing weapons and ammunition
3. **Ballistic Trajectories**: Angle-dependent armor effectiveness
4. **Armor Profiles**: Different effectiveness vs range/weapon types

### Quality of Life

1. **Loadout Presets**: Save/load complete armor configurations
2. **Armor Recommendations**: System suggests optimal armor for threats
3. **Maintenance Tracking**: Automated armor condition monitoring
4. **Visual Indicators**: Clear armor status in character descriptions
