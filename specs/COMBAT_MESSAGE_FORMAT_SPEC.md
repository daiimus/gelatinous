# Combat Message Format Specification
**Version 1.0 - Message Refactoring Guidelines**

## Overview

This specification defines the standardized format for combat messages across all weapon types in the gelatinous combat system. The goal is to refactor existing messages from the old single-string format to the new multi-perspective dictionary format while preserving the rich, atmospheric content and distinctive tone.

## Current State Analysis

### Format Status by File Type:
- ‚úÖ **Already Converted**: `anti-material_rifle.py`, `unarmed.py`, `grapple.py`
- üîÑ **Needs Refactoring**: ~80 weapon message files (knife.py, chainsaw.py, meat_hook.py, etc.)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Special Cases**: `grapple.py` (extended phases), `unarmed.py` (base template)

### Existing Content Quality:
- **Rich, atmospheric messages** with visceral descriptions
- **Cinematic tone** influenced by:
  - Film noir and gritty crime fiction
  - Horror/thriller aesthetics  
  - Hardboiled detective fiction
  - Industrial/urban decay atmosphere
  - Psychological tension and dread
- **Technical weapon details** integrated naturally
- **Multiple message variants** per phase (10-20+ per category)
- **Consistent voice** across different weapon types

## Target Format Specification

### Standard Structure:
```python
MESSAGES = {
    "phase_name": [
        {
            "attacker_msg": "You [action] with {item_name}...",
            "victim_msg": "{attacker_name} [action] at you with {item_name}...", 
            "observer_msg": "{attacker_name} [action] with {item_name}..."
        },
        # ... additional message variants (10-20+ recommended)
    ],
    # ... additional phases
}
```

### Required Phases:
1. **`initiate`** - Combat preparation/weapon readying messages
2. **`hit`** - Successful attack messages  
3. **`miss`** - Failed attack messages
4. **`kill`** - Fatal blow messages (optional, can fall back to hit)

### Special Extended Phases (for specific weapons):
- **`escape_hit`** / **`escape_miss`** - Grappling escape attempts
- **`release`** - Voluntary release of grapples
- **`grapple_damage_hit`** / **`grapple_damage_miss`** / **`grapple_damage_kill`** - Damage while grappling

### Standard Placeholders:
- **`{attacker_name}`** - Attacker's display name (for victim/observer messages)
- **`{target_name}`** - Target's display name (for attacker/observer messages)  
- **`{item_name}`** - Weapon/item name
- **`{damage}`** - Damage dealt (for hit/kill messages)

### Message Perspective Guidelines:

#### Attacker Messages (First Person):
- Use "You" perspective
- Focus on the character's actions, sensations, intent
- Include tactical/technical weapon details
- Emphasize control and deliberation

**Example**: 
```
"You meticulously line up the shot with your anti-material rifle, knowing a single round can vaporize {target_name}."
```

#### Victim Messages (Second Person):
- Use "you" for the victim, "{attacker_name}" for the aggressor
- Emphasize the threat/danger directed at the victim
- Include victim-specific sensory details
- Build tension and immediacy

**Example**:
```
"{attacker_name} meticulously lines up the shot with their anti-material rifle, knowing a single round can vaporize you."
```

#### Observer Messages (Third Person):
- Use "{attacker_name}" and "{target_name}"
- Focus on external, visible actions
- Maintain atmospheric tension
- Avoid victim-specific internal details

**Example**:
```
"{attacker_name} meticulously lines up the shot with the anti-material rifle, knowing a single round can vaporize {target_name}."
```

## Tone and Style Guidelines

### Core Aesthetic Influences:
- **Film Noir**: Shadows, moral ambiguity, stark contrasts
- **Industrial Horror**: Mechanical brutality, urban decay
- **Hardboiled Fiction**: Terse, economical prose with punch
- **Psychological Thriller**: Building dread, intimate violence
- **Crime Drama**: Professional competence meets personal stakes

### Writing Style Requirements:

#### Language Characteristics:
- **Terse, punchy sentences** with strong rhythm
- **Visceral, tactile descriptions** that engage multiple senses
- **Technical authenticity** woven naturally into narrative
- **Atmospheric details** that build mood and tension
- **Varied sentence structure** to create rhythm and flow

#### Tone Elements:
- **Deliberate pacing** - Actions feel inevitable, not rushed
- **Professional competence** - Characters know their weapons/craft
- **Underlying menace** - Even preparation feels threatening
- **Sensory richness** - Sound, texture, weight, temperature
- **Emotional restraint** - Violence is matter-of-fact, not theatrical

#### Example Analysis from Existing Content:

**Chainsaw (old format)**:
```
"A guttural sound fills the room as the saw turns over. It doesn't want to start ‚Äî it *needs* to."
```
- ‚úÖ Mechanical personification
- ‚úÖ Ominous inevitability  
- ‚úÖ Sensory detail (sound)
- ‚úÖ Psychological undertones

**Anti-material Rifle (new format)**:
```
"attacker_msg": "You meticulously line up the shot with your anti-material rifle, knowing a single round can vaporize {target_name}."
```
- ‚úÖ Technical competence
- ‚úÖ Calculated deliberation
- ‚úÖ Understated lethality
- ‚úÖ Professional focus

## Refactoring Process

### Step 1: Content Preservation
- **DO NOT TRUNCATE** existing message content
- **PRESERVE** the atmospheric quality and specific details
- **MAINTAIN** the established voice and tone
- **CONVERT** single strings to three-perspective format

### Step 2: Perspective Adaptation
For each existing message, create three versions:
1. **Attacker**: Convert to first-person "You" perspective
2. **Victim**: Add victim-specific threat awareness
3. **Observer**: Maintain third-person observational view

### Step 3: Placeholder Updates
- Replace `{attacker}` with `{attacker_name}` (victim/observer only)
- Replace `{target}` with `{target_name}` (attacker/observer only)
- Add `{item_name}` references where appropriate
- Add `{damage}` for hit/kill messages

### Step 4: Content Enhancement
- **Expand message variety** if needed (target: 10-20 per phase)
- **Add technical details** specific to weapon type
- **Enhance sensory descriptions** while maintaining tone
- **Ensure phase coverage** (initiate, hit, miss, kill minimum)

## Quality Assurance Checklist

### Content Quality:
- [ ] All existing atmospheric content preserved
- [ ] Three-perspective format implemented correctly
- [ ] Tone consistency maintained across perspectives
- [ ] Technical weapon details included naturally
- [ ] Sensory descriptions rich and varied

### Technical Requirements:
- [ ] Standard placeholders used correctly
- [ ] Required phases present (initiate, hit, miss, kill)
- [ ] Dictionary structure matches specification
- [ ] No truncated or lost content from original
- [ ] Message variety adequate (10+ per phase preferred)

### Tone Verification:
- [ ] Professional competence conveyed
- [ ] Atmospheric tension maintained

- [ ] Pacing feels deliberate and inevitable

## Special Cases

### Grapple.py:
- Already converted ‚úÖ
- Extended phases: `escape_hit`, `escape_miss`, `release`, `grapple_damage_*`
- Use as template for other close-combat weapons

### Unarmed.py:
- Already converted ‚úÖ
- Standard four-phase structure
- Good baseline template for conversion

### Weapon-Specific Considerations:
- **Firearms**: Emphasize technical preparation, recoil, ballistics
- **Bladed Weapons**: Focus on edge quality, precision, intimate violence
- **Improvised Weapons**: Highlight adaptation, desperation, creativity
- **Power Tools**: Mechanical personality, industrial brutality
- **Explosives**: Countdown tension, area effect awareness

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: High-Priority Weapons (in use by prototypes)
- [ ] `knife.py` - DAGGER prototype
- [ ] `long_sword.py` - SWORD prototype  
- [ ] `baseball_bat.py` - BASEBALL_BAT prototype
- [ ] `staff.py` - STAFF prototype
- [ ] `throwing_knife.py` - THROWING_KNIFE prototype
- [ ] `throwing_axe.py` - THROWING_AXE prototype
- [ ] `shuriken.py` - SHURIKEN prototype

### Phase 2: Common Weapons
- [ ] `crowbar.py`, `hammer.py`, `machete.py`, `katana.py`
- [ ] `battle_axe.py`, `chainsaw.py`, `pipe_wrench.py`
- [ ] `brick.py`, `broken_bottle.py`, `tire_iron.py`

### Phase 3: Specialized/Exotic Weapons
- [ ] Firearms, exotic melee, improvised weapons
- [ ] Less common but atmospheric weapons

## Notes for Implementation

### Conversion Workflow:
1. **Backup original** file content
2. **Analyze existing messages** for tone and content
3. **Create three-perspective versions** of each message
4. **Test format** with message system
5. **Verify tone consistency** across perspectives
6. **Expand content** if message count is low

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- ‚ùå Truncating rich atmospheric content
- ‚ùå Making victim messages identical to observer messages
- ‚ùå Losing technical weapon-specific details
- ‚ùå Breaking the established noir/industrial tone
- ‚ùå Rushing the conversion without preserving quality

### Success Criteria:
- ‚úÖ All original atmospheric content preserved and enhanced
- ‚úÖ Three distinct but consistent perspectives per message
- ‚úÖ Technical integration with combat system
- ‚úÖ Tone consistency maintained across all weapon types
- ‚úÖ Enhanced player immersion through perspective-specific details

---

**Remember**: These messages are a core part of the game's atmospheric identity. The refactoring should enhance and preserve this identity, not diminish it through technical convenience.
