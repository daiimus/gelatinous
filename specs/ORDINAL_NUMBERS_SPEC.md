# Ordinal Number Support - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented natural language ordinal number support for multimatch disambiguation in Evennia commands. Players can now use intuitive commands like "get 1st mushroom" instead of "get mushroom-1".

## Features Implemented

### Numeric Ordinals
- 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc.
- Supports any numeric ordinal (21st, 22nd, 23rd, etc.)

### Written Ordinals  
- first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth

### Universal Support
Works with all commands that use Evennia's search system:
- `look first can` (same as `look can-1`)
- `get 2nd mushroom` (same as `get mushroom-2`) 
- `wield third sword` (same as `wield sword-3`)
- `unwield 1st axe` (same as `unwield axe-1`)

## Technical Implementation

### Core Changes

1. **typeclasses/objects.py** - ObjectParent Enhancement
   - Added `ORDINAL_WORDS` dictionary for written ordinals
   - Added `ORDINAL_REGEX` for pattern matching
   - Override `get_search_query_replacement()` method
   - Automatic conversion: "1st mushroom" → "mushroom-1"

2. **commands/CmdInventory.py** - Search Method Updates
   - Updated `_find_item_in_inventory()` to use `caller.search()`
   - Updated `CmdUnwield.func()` to use standard search system
   - Now benefits from ObjectParent ordinal conversion

3. **server/conf/at_search.py** - Enhanced Search Handler
   - Custom search result handler with ordinal-aware messaging
   - Better multimatch error messages for both formats

4. **server/conf/settings.py** - Configuration
   - `SEARCH_AT_RESULT` setting points to custom handler

### Key Technical Details

- **Regex Pattern**: `^(?P<ordinal>(?:\d+(?:st|nd|rd|th)|first|second|third|fourth|fifth|sixth|seventh|eighth|ninth|tenth))\s+(?P<rest>.+)$`
- **Conversion Logic**: Extracts ordinal and converts to Evennia's dash-number format
- **Integration Point**: ObjectParent mixin ensures universal application
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing dash-number format continues to work

## Testing Results

All test cases pass successfully:
- ✅ Numeric ordinals (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 21st, 22nd, 23rd)
- ✅ Written ordinals (first, second, third, fourth, fifth, tenth)  
- ✅ Non-ordinal searches remain unchanged
- ✅ Integration with look, get, wield, unwield commands
- ✅ Standard Evennia multimatch behavior preserved

## Benefits

1. **Natural Language**: More intuitive command syntax
2. **Universal Application**: Works with all search-based commands
3. **Backward Compatible**: Doesn't break existing functionality
4. **Consistent**: Same ordinal support across all game systems
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add more ordinal words if needed

## Usage Examples

```
> get 1st mushroom        # Gets the first mushroom in your inventory
> wield second sword      # Wields the second sword you're carrying  
> look third can          # Examines the third aerosol can in the room
> unwield 2nd axe         # Unwields the second axe you're holding
```

The system seamlessly converts these natural language commands to Evennia's standard multimatch format internally while maintaining full compatibility with existing commands and systems.
