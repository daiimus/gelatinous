# Phase 2.5: Complete Consumption System - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**Date:** September 12, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

## Summary

Phase 2.5 completes the natural language consumption method system by implementing the final two consumption commands: `inhale` and `smoke`. This achieves the goal of a comprehensive medical interface that covers all planned consumption methods.

## Implemented Features

### New Commands
- **`inhale <item>`** - For oxygen tanks, inhalers, anesthetic gases, medical vapors
  - Aliases: `huff`, `breathe`
  - Syntax: `inhale <item>` or `help <target> inhale <item>`
  - Requires conscious target
  
- **`smoke <item>`** - For medicinal herbs, cigarettes, dried medicines
  - Aliases: `light`, `burn`  
  - Syntax: `smoke <item>` or `help <target> smoke <item>`
  - Requires conscious target

### New Medical Types
**Inhalation Types:**
- `oxygen` - Consciousness boost, breathing difficulty treatment
- `anesthetic` - Pain reduction with consciousness side effects
- `inhaler` - Targeted respiratory treatment
- `gas` - General medical gas effects
- `vapor` - Fast-absorption vaporized medicines

**Smoking Types:**
- `herb` - Natural pain relief and stress reduction
- `cigarette` - Mild medicinal cigarette effects
- `medicinal_plant` - Concentrated plant medicine effects
- `dried_medicine` - Dried medicinal substance effects

### New Prototype Examples
- **Oxygen Tank** - Emergency respiratory support (10 uses)
- **Stimpak Inhaler** - Vaporized stimpak for rapid absorption (1 use)
- **Anesthetic Gas** - Medical knockout gas for pain relief (5 uses)
- **Medicinal Herb** - Natural smoking herb for pain/stress (3 uses)
- **Pain Relief Cigarette** - Medicinal cigarette for mild relief (1 use)

## Technical Implementation

### File Changes
1. **`commands/CmdConsumption.py`** - Added `CmdInhale` and `CmdSmoke` classes
2. **`commands/default_cmdsets.py`** - Added commands to default command set
3. **`world/medical/utils.py`** - Added medical effects for new types
4. **`world/prototypes.py`** - Added 5 new medical item prototypes
5. **`specs/HEALTH_AND_SUBSTANCE_SYSTEM_SPEC.md`** - Updated documentation

### Command Integration
- Commands follow exact same pattern as existing consumption commands
- Full integration with medical state system
- Proper error handling for unconscious targets
- Medical type validation and effects application
- Uses existing utility functions for consistency

### Medical Effects
All new medical types have realistic effects on character medical state:
- Consciousness manipulation (boost/reduction)
- Pain level modification
- Breathing condition treatment
- Stress/anxiety relief for natural substances
- Blood level and other vital sign effects

## Usage Examples

```
> inhale oxygen tank
You breathe in oxygen tank deeply.
Inhalation result: Oxygen administered. Breathing improved and consciousness stabilized.

> smoke medicinal herb  
You light and smoke medicinal herb, inhaling the medicinal smoke.
Smoking result: Medicinal herb smoked. Natural pain relief and calming effects.

> help Alice inhale stimpak vapor
You help Alice inhale stimpak vapor.
Inhalation result: Vaporized medicine inhaled. Rapid absorption achieved.
```

## Testing

Commands can be tested with:
```
spawn oxygen_tank
inhale oxygen tank

spawn medicinal_herb
smoke medicinal herb
```

## Next Development Priorities

With Phase 2.5 complete, the consumption system foundation is solid. Recommended next steps:

1. **Enhanced Medical Treatment** - Multi-round procedures, interruption mechanics
2. **Wound Staging System** - Infection progression, healing timelines  
3. **Medical Emergency Scenarios** - Triage, stabilization procedures
4. **Advanced Medical Features** - Disease progression, drug dependencies

The medical system now provides a complete, natural language interface for all planned consumption methods, establishing a solid foundation for advanced medical gameplay features.
