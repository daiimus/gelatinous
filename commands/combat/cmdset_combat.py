"""
Combat Command Set

Defines the command set for all combat-related commands, organized using
the new modular structure. This provides a clean interface for adding
combat commands to characters during combat situations.

This replaces the old monolithic approach with a well-organized, maintainable
structure that follows Python and Evennia best practices.
