"""
One-time admin command to repair legacy character ownership.

This fixes characters created with the old broken manual method by properly
establishing Evennia's internal ownership relationships using the account's
internal _add_character method.

This command will be obsolete once all legacy characters are fixed.

    ONE-TIME FIX for legacy character ownership.
    
    Usage:
        @fixchar <character name>
        @fixchar all
        @fixchar undo
    
    This repairs characters created before we switched to account.create_character()
    by using Evennia's internal character tracking methods.
    
    Legacy characters were created with manual setup and don't appear in
    account.characters. This command fixes that by checking the character's
    puppet lock for your account ID.
    
    Use 'all' to fix all characters that have your account ID in their puppet lock.
    Use 'undo' to remove ALL characters from your account.characters list (emergency cleanup).
