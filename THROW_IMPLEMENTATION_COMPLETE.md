## ðŸ“‹ **COMMAND SYNTAX REFERENCE**

### **Throw Command (4 Variations)**
```
throw <object>                    # Throw in aimed direction or randomly
throw <object> at <target>        # Target specific character  
throw <object> to <direction>     # Throw to adjacent room
throw <object> to here            # Throw randomly in current room
```

### **Grenade Commands**
```
pull pin on <grenade>             # Arm grenade, start countdown
catch <object>                    # Catch flying object
rig <grenade> to <exit>           # Trap exit with armed grenade
drop <object>                     # Enhanced with proximity assignment
```

## ðŸ”§ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **File Structure**
```
commands/
â”œâ”€â”€ CmdThrow.py                   # Main throw command system
â””â”€â”€ default_cmdsets.py            # Command registration

world/combat/
â”œâ”€â”€ constants.py                  # All throw/grenade constants
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py                      # Enhanced with damage system
â””â”€â”€ throw_test_suite.py           # Test and demo script

typeclasses/
â””â”€â”€ rooms.py                      # Enhanced with flying objects display
```

### **Property System**
```python
# Throwing weapons
obj.db.is_throwing_weapon = True
obj.db.damage = 3

# Explosives  
obj.db.is_explosive = True
obj.db.fuse_time = 8              # Countdown seconds
obj.db.blast_damage = 20          # Damage amount
obj.db.requires_pin = True        # Pin pulling required
obj.db.chain_trigger = True       # Can trigger other explosives
obj.db.dud_chance = 0.1          # 10% failure rate
```

### **Universal Proximity Integration**
- **Enhanced drop command** assigns `obj.ndb.proximity = [dropper]` for all objects
- **Grenade landing** inherits proximity from target character  
- **Chain reactions** enabled through object-to-object proximity
- **Retreat compatibility** works with any proximity (character or object)

## ðŸŽ® **GAMEPLAY FEATURES**

### **Tactical Throwing**
- **Smart parsing** - Intelligent syntax interpretation with error recovery
- **Cross-room targeting** - Requires aim state for distant targets
- **Combat integration** - Weapon throws enter combat and consume turns
- **Flight announcements** - 2-second flight with room-specific messages

### **Grenade Mechanics**
- **Pin pulling system** - Must arm before throwing
- **Timer inheritance** - Countdown continues during flight
- **Hot potato mechanics** - Can catch and re-throw live grenades
- **Area denial** - Dropped grenades create danger zones
- **Exit trapping** - Rig grenades to explode on movement

### **Property-Driven Explosives**
- **Standard Grenade**: 8s fuse, 20 damage, pin required
- **Impact Grenade**: Instant explosion, 15 damage, no pin
- **Flashbang**: 2s fuse, 5 damage, stun effects
- **Dud Training**: 100% failure rate for practice

### **Chain Reaction System**
- **Proximity inheritance** - Explosions affect overlapping proximity
- **Multi-grenade scenarios** - Complex tactical positioning puzzles
- **Retreat mechanics** - Standard retreat escapes explosive proximity

## ðŸ›  **TESTING & VALIDATION**

### **Test Objects Creation**
```python
# Run the test suite to create demo objects
exec(open('world/combat/throw_test_suite.py').read())
```

### **Demo Scenarios**
1. **Utility throwing** - Keys, items between rooms
2. **Weapon combat** - Knife throwing with damage
3. **Grenade timing** - Pin pulling and countdown
4. **Catch mechanics** - Mid-air interception  
5. **Exit rigging** - Trap deployment
6. **Chain reactions** - Multiple explosive interactions

## ðŸŽ¯ **INTEGRATION POINTS**

### **Existing Systems Enhanced**
- **Mr. Hand System** - Validates wielding for throws
- **Combat Handler** - Processes weapon throws as attacks
- **Proximity System** - Extended for universal object proximity
- **Aim System** - Enables cross-room targeted throwing
- **Retreat Command** - Works with grenade proximity escape

### **New Systems Added**
